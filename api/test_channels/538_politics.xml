<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html">Tara Reade says</a> that in 1993, then-Sen. Joe Biden pressed her up against a wall in the United States Senate, kissed her neck and hair, slid his hand under her blouse, then used his knee to spread her legs and penetrated her with his fingers. Biden <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-biden-this-is-an-open-book-there-is-nothing-for-me-to-hide-82865221937?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma">denied the allegations</a> Friday: “I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened.”</p>
<p>The country has spent four years in a messy reckoning over sexual assault, harassment and accountability. Every high-profile case has been argued on its own terms, and Biden’s will be no different. But past instances of sexual assault allegations in politics have shown that it’s party officials who help decide whether a politician weathers the storm. If precedent tells us anything, it’s that establishment Democrats will help determine whether Reade’s account has any impact on Biden’s campaign. In politics, believing women is complicated.</p>
<p>Biden isn’t a stranger to accusations that he’s made women uncomfortable. Last year, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/04/joe-biden-accuser-accusations-allegations.html">a number of women alleged</a> that he invaded their personal space in ways that felt inappropriate, if not sexual &#8212; though some felt his touching was indeed sexual. Reade was among those who came forward with an account, though at the time she did not relate her allegation that Biden had pressed her against the wall.</p>
<p>The public reaction to the initial allegations was muted. A <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/poll-democrats-unfazed-by-joe-bidens-handsiness-1264132?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=0000014e-f115-dd93-ad7f-f91513e50001&amp;nlid=630318">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> of Democratic voters found that half of respondents said the allegations would have no bearing on whether they’d decide to support Biden, and 32 percent of Democrats said that he hadn’t behaved inappropriately at all. <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/437552-poll-voters-believe-bidens-conduct-with-women-should-not">The Hill and HarrisX ran a poll</a> around the same time that found that 62 percent of Democrats said the allegations shouldn’t preclude his presidential ambitions.</p>
<p>Of course, Reade’s new allegations are quite different from the ones Biden faced last year. Vaginal penetration falls under the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape">Justice Department’s definition of rape</a>.</p>
<p>In many ways, Biden is in a precarious political position with his Democratic base. The party has squared itself firmly behind the “believe women” ethos of the MeToo movement, and Democratic voters have consistently showed less tolerance for sexual misconduct and assault. A <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/04/04/sexual-harassment-at-work-in-the-era-of-metoo/">Pew Research Center survey from 2018</a> found that 62 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents thought that men getting away with sexual harassment was a major problem and 60 percent said the same about women not being believed when they lodge harassment claims. Those numbers were about double the share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who said those issues were major problems.</p>
<p>There was a similar partisan gap when Christine Blasey Ford and others accused Justice Brett Kavanaugh of past sexual misconduct. An <a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/662519588/poll-reveals-divided-understanding-of-metoo">NPR/Ipsos survey</a> conducted in October 2018, a month after Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, found 75 percent of Republicans thought the MeToo movement had gone too far, but only 21 percent of Democrats thought so.</p>
<p>The question, of course, is whether numbers like those will hold when a Democrat is involved. For example, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/battleground-house-districts-remain-close-in-new-poll/2018/10/22/e6c77a32-d63e-11e8-aeb7-ddcad4a0a54e_story.html">Washington Post-Schar School poll</a> conducted shortly after the Kavanaugh hearings found that 76 percent of Republicans were concerned that men could be accused unfairly of sexual assault. Only 34 percent of Democrats felt the same. Theoretically, that could mean trouble for Biden.</p>
<p>But Democrats’ principled stance on sexual misconduct can soften a little &#8212; or at least get more complicated &#8212; when it comes to members of their own party. Sen. Al Franken resigned in 2017 after Leeann Tweeden alleged he forcibly kissed her during a USO tour and a photo appeared to show him groping her while she slept. In November of 2017, 59 percent of Democratic survey respondents in a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2017/11/22/voters-take-hard-line-on-sexual-misconduct-as-allegations-mount/">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> said elected officials &#8212; generically &#8212; should resign if faced with credible allegations of misconduct. But only 49 percent of Democrats in the same survey were in favor of Franken, specifically, resigning. A <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/361490-poll-22-percent-of-minnesotans-say-franken-should-remain-in-office">KSTP/SurveyUSA poll</a> of Minnesotans from the same time found 34 percent of Democrats said he should remain in office, 14 percent thought he should resign and 46 percent thought he should wait for the results of an ethics investigation.</p>
<p>But while Democratic constituents waffled, Democratic elected officials were more decisive. In early December 2017, a group of Franken’s Democratic Senate colleagues, led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/06/gillibrand-calls-on-franken-to-resign-282112">demanded he resign</a>. <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/07/franken-resigns-285957">Franken did so a day later</a>, his fate sealed by his colleagues’ loss of confidence.</p>
<p>Franken’s case shows that what can truly sound the death knell of a politician’s run is the loss of support from party insiders; the condemnation of one’s peers is a damning thing in this line of work. After the “Access Hollywood” tape revealed that Donald Trump had bragged about making unwanted advances on women, some Republicans, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/paul-ryan-told-gop-it-could-abandon-trump-after-access-hollywood-tape-book">including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan</a>, abandoned him. But he maintained the backing of powerful allies like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and, luckily for Trump, his scandal broke close enough to Election Day that Republicans had few viable choices to replace him.</p>
<p>So far, Democrats seem to be following a similar playbook, perhaps because Biden is running against Trump. The president has been accused of sexual assault &#8212; including rape &#8212; <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/list-trumps-accusers-allegations-sexual-misconduct/story?id=51956410">by 17 women</a>. Even if the accusations against Biden are true, Democrats might be willing to rationalize voting for him if they perceive him as the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>Democratic officials have closed ranks around Biden even as Reade’s allegations have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-neighbor-corroborates-joe-bidens-accuser-2020-4">received further</a> attention and reporting. When asked about Reade’s allegations, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-joe-biden-support/index.html">Gillibrand said</a>, “I support Vice President Biden.”</p>
<p>The political cover that Biden already built for himself by declaring that he would choose a female vice president &#8212; a consolation prize of sorts for voters disappointed by their white, male de facto nominee &#8212; is paying off as his campaign fights Reade’s allegations. Potential vice presidential picks have, so far, not come out against Biden. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said, “I think this case has been investigated,” and talked about Biden’s record on helping victims of domestic abuse. Another senator in the vice presidential running, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rubycramer/joe-biden-tara-reade-talking-points-campaign-defense">Kamala Harris, said</a> Reade “has a right to tell her story” and that she could “only speak to the Joe Biden I know. He’s been a lifelong fighter, in terms of stopping violence against women.” <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/495340-democrats-begin-to-confront-biden-allegations">Stacey Abrams</a>, another vice presidential contender, said, “I know Joe Biden, and I think he’s telling the truth and this did not happen.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/developments-in-allegations-against-biden-amplify-efforts-to-question-his-behavior/2020/04/27/88869bc2-88be-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html">Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</a>, herself a survivor of rape and another name that has been batted about in vice presidential speculation, was slightly more circumspect when asked about Reade: “Well, I think women should be able to tell their stories. I think that it is important that these allegations are vetted, from the media to beyond. And I think that, you know, it is something that no one takes lightly,” Whitmer said. “But it is also something that is, you know, personal. And so it’s hard to give you greater insight than that, not knowing more about the situation.”</p>
<p>The Biden campaign <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rubycramer/joe-biden-tara-reade-talking-points-campaign-defense">sent out talking points</a> this week for surrogates who will need to address the Reade question. “Here’s the bottom line: Vice President Joe Biden has spent over 40 years in public life: 36 years in the Senate; 7 Senate campaigns, 2 previous presidential runs, two vice presidential campaigns, and 8 years in the White House. There has never been a complaint, allegation, hint or rumor of any impropriety or inappropriate conduct like this regarding him – ever.”</p>
<p>The plan for now, it would appear, is to deny, deny, deny and encourage Democratic officials to do the same. In the political world, that calculus isn’t half bad and has worked to great effect: President Trump, it should be noted, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/list-trumps-accusers-allegations-sexual-misconduct/story?id=51956410">continues to deny</a> all 17 assault claims against him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>
<h2><b>Poll(s) of the week </b></h2>
<p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, leads President Trump in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/">most national polls</a>, and surveys conducted even this far out have tended to roughly resemble the eventual general election results, as FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-can-pay-attention-to-those-trump-vs-biden-polls-but-be-cautious/">explained in an article this week</a>. Of course, national polls measure the national popular vote, which is really only <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-odds-of-an-electoral-college-popular-vote-split-are-increasing/">indirectly related</a> to who will win the White House &#8212; Democrats have won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College in <a href="https://time.com/5579161/presidents-elected-electoral-college/">two of the last seven elections</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/how-trump-could-lose-5-million-votes-still-win-2020-n1031601">could do so again in 2020</a>. U.S. presidential elections are really a contest of states.</p>
<p>So what’s going on in the states? We thought it was worth taking a look at that question now, as April featured some high-quality, state-level polling (though not a ton of it<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="1" href="#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;There were only 41 total polls of just 19 states released in April, at least by &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&rsquo;s count&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a>). It also happened to be the month when the general election came into sharper focus: It’s now clear who the Democratic nominee will be and that the novel coronavirus pandemic will be a major part of the campaign.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="2" href="#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;One caution, though: The coronavirus outbreak and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/27/mccourt-trumps-coronavirus-leadership-awful-for-us-and-the-world.html&quot;&gt;criticism of Trump&rsquo;s handling of it&lt;/a&gt; might make April a particularly unfavorable month to assess his chances of winning reelection. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a></p>
<p>Here’s what we learned looking at every state-level poll conducted in April:<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="3" href="#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;We included polls in which some of the respondents were contacted in late March but the full survey was not finished until April. We thought that made sense for two reasons. First, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-does-biden-need-sanders-voters-to-beat-trump/&quot;&gt;late March&lt;/a&gt;, it was fairly clear that Biden would be the Democratic nominee. Second, we wanted to include as many surveys as possible to broaden our sample.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-3">3</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Biden’s leads narrowly in several key states</strong></p>
<p>Several polling firms released surveys of Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in April. Former President Barack Obama carried all four states in 2012. Trump flipped all four in 2016 (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/swing-state-margins/">as well as Ohio and Iowa</a>, neither of which has much recent polling.) And Biden appears to lead in all four now. (North Carolina, which has gone Republican in both of the last two cycles, was also polled pretty often in April, with Trump and Biden looking basically tied there.)</p>

</section>
<p>This data highlights a few things. First, at least at the moment, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are very close to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-had-a-superior-electoral-college-strategy/">national tipping point</a> &#8212; so they’re likely to be among the more determinative states this November. Second, the former vice president’s lead nationally is big enough to carry these states. This is important &#8212; if Biden wins all of the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016 <a href="https://www.270towin.com">plus any combination of three of these four</a>, he would be elected president.</p>
<p>But crucially, Biden’s margins in these states are slightly smaller than his advantage in national polls. It’s worth thinking about the race at the state level in these relative terms because there’s still so much time for things to shift. If Biden’s lead nationally narrowed to 2 to 3 percentage points, these states would likely be much closer, if not lean toward Trump. Also, as The New York Times’ Nate Cohn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/upshot/polling-2020-biden-trump.html">wrote recently</a>, Trump is likely to look stronger when pollsters start limiting their results to “likely voters.” Most of the April surveys in these four states were conducted among registered voters or all adults, two groups that include some people who may not vote in November.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="4" href="#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Democrats &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/upshot/2020-election-turnout-analysis.html&quot;&gt;tend to do better&lt;/a&gt; in surveys of adults and registered voters than among likely voters.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></a></p>
<p>In other words, this data suggests Trump may have an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/upshot/trump-electoral-college-edge-.html">Electoral College advantage again</a> &#8212; he could lose the popular vote and win the election. Of course, this data also suggests that if Biden is winning overall by a margin similar to his advantage now, Trump’s potential Electoral College edge really won’t matter.</p>
<p><b>Biden polling particularly strong in Michigan and Pennsylvania </b></p>
<p>It’s not worth making too much of small differences among states &#8212; we don’t have a lot of polling and things will likely shift between now and November anyway. But it seems pretty clear Biden is doing better in Michigan and Pennsylvania than Florida and Wisconsin. Fox News, Ipsos and Public Policy Polling all recently polled several swing states. All three found Biden had a larger lead in Michigan and Pennsylvania than in other swing states they surveyed (Florida for Fox, North Carolina and Wisconsin for PPP, Wisconsin for Ipsos.)</p>
<p><b>The race is unclear in other Trump 2016 states </b></p>
<p>Outside of the five states I discussed above, a recent poll of Arizona was great for the former vice president, while he wasn’t looking as strong in a survey of Georgia. But I would be very cautious about states in which we only have one or two recent polls. So please keep that caveat in mind, but here are <i>all</i> the states for which we got polls in April &#8212; even the ones with just one poll:</p>

<p>I do think Biden could win Arizona, but that’s based more on Democrats’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-arizona-elections.html">winning a U.S. Senate race there in 2018</a> than the <a href="https://ohpredictive.com/press-releases/bidenextendslead/">recent OH Predictive Insights survey</a> that showed Biden with a 9-point lead in the state.</p>
<p><b>It’s also unclear in Clinton 2016 states</b></p>
<p>It’s likely that Trump and Republicans will target Maine, Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire in particular &#8212; looking for an upset in states Democrats could overlook because they might assume Biden won’t lose where Clinton won four years ago. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president">narrowly lost in those four states in 2016</a>.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="5" href="#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;He lost Maine by 3.0 points, Minnesota by 1.5 points, Nevada by 2.4 and New Hampshire by 0.4.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a> Maine, Minnesota and New Hampshire are states in which a disproportionately high percentage of the electorate is <a href="https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2019/06/26070322/StatesOfChange2019-report1.pdf">non-Hispanic white voters without college degrees</a>, an electoral bloc in which the president was <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/">especially strong in 2016</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/opinion/trump-white-voters.html">could make even more gains in 2020</a>.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="6" href="#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;A 2018 report from demographic experts suggested the American electorate nationally is 42 to 44 percent white non-Hispanic voters. That bloc is estimated to be 63-64 percent of voters in Maine, 55-56 percent of New Hampshire&rsquo;s electorate and 52-54 percent in Minnesota, but only 41-43 percent in Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-6">6</sup></a></p>
<p>But we just need more polling to get a sense for how these states are shaping up relative to the country overall. All we have is one recent poll from any of these four states &#8212; a survey showing the former vice president ahead by 8 points in New Hampshire. Biden’s prospects would be brighter if he ends up outperforming Clinton among non-college whites, making these states less Republican-leaning relative to the country than they were in 2016.</p>
<h2><b>Other polling bites </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Among registered voters in New York, 32 percent said they <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/2020/04/27/coronavirus-pandemic-pushes-cuomo-to-record-high-ratings-voters-trust-cuomo-over-trump-on-ny-reopening-78-16/">personally know someone who has died as a result of the coronavirus</a>, according to a <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SNY0420-Crosstabs.pdf">new Siena College Research Institute poll</a>, compared to 67 percent who said they did not. That first number is higher among the state’s black (48 percent) and Latino registered voters (52 percent), as well as those who live in New York City (46 percent.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">About 37 percent of American adults said they had a positive view of capitalism, compared to 41 percent with a neutral view and 21 percent who viewed capitalism negatively, according to <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/4/27/coronavirus-response-tracking-poll-1">a new poll</a> from the <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/about">left-leaning firm Data for Progress</a>. Socialism is less popular, at 18 percent positive, 44 percent neutral, 38 percent negative.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">More than half of American adults said their employment status had been negatively affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/309299/covid-disrupts-americans-jobs-finances.aspx">a recent Gallup poll</a>. The effects included a loss of income (26 percent), hours being reduced (15 percent), being temporarily laid off (10 percent) and losing their job permanently (2 percent). Of the adults who were surveyed who live in households with incomes below $35,000, 68 percent said they had experienced at least one of these four negative effects. Among those in households with incomes over $90,000 per year, 49 percent said they had experienced at least one.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">30 percent of American adults said they thought Trump was kidding when he suggested that scientists study the idea of people injecting disinfectants into their bodies as a way to fight the coronavirus, according to a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/04/27/a699b/2">recent YouGov survey</a>. The majority of Americans (54 percent) did not think Trump was joking. There was a clear partisan split: 68 percent of Republicans said the president was kidding, compared to 16 percent who said he was not and another 16 percent who said they were not sure.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Black adults (28 percent) were more likely than Hispanic (13 percent) or non-Hispanic white (9 percent) adults to say they know someone who has died from COVID-19, according to a <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index-poll-week-7-a4c299b6-307c-4103-8d72-b5cc2b5a37e5.html">recent Axios-Ipsos survey</a>. People in the Northeast (25 percent) were more likely to know someone who has died of the virus than those in the South (12 percent), Midwest (8 percent) or West (7 percent.) Democrats (15 percent) were more likely to know someone who has died than Republicans (8 percent.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">A <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1evYWT-YmsJb5UX84u_l7CgmpY-1T4Hvtiu1R4KO3_oA/edit#gid=0">recent Washington Post/University of Maryland survey</a> found 65 percent of American adults supported temporarily blocking immigration to the U.S. during the COVID-19 outbreak. (Trump recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-immigration-ban.html">enacted a temporary halt to the issuing of green cards</a>, although the pollsters who conducted this survey <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/washington-post-university-of-maryland-national-poll-april-21-26-2020/3583b4e9-66be-4ed6-a457-f6630a550ddf/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2">did not refer to the president’s announcement in their question</a>.) Republicans (83 percent) and independents (67 percent) overwhelmingly favored this idea, while Democrats were split (49 percent supported it, 49 percent opposed it.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Relatively few registered voters (31 percent) said they thought Trump is “honest and trustworthy,” according to a <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/national/2020/4_27_2020_marginals_pdftxt.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=336A52F32EBA7EC16967E96B8CE8FB0311EC454B">new USA Today/Suffolk University poll</a>. But Trump gets higher marks on standing up for American interests (53 percent of voters agreed with this notion), knowing how to get things done (51 percent), being a strong leader (45 percent), working with foreign leaders (45 percent) and caring about “people like me” (39 percent.) Biden was rated the highest by voters on being able to work with foreign leaders (64 percent said they agree with this notion) and was ahead of Trump in three other measures as well. But voters weren’t that confident that Biden is a strong leader (43 percent) or can get things done (48 percent.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">A total of 67 percent of adults said they thought COVID-19 would “significantly disrupt” Americans’s ability to vote in November’s elections, according to a <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/28/two-thirds-of-americans-expect-presidential-election-will-be-disrupted-by-covid-19/">new Pew Research survey</a>.</li>

<p>According to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/">presidential approval tracker</a>, 42.9 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.4 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -9.5 points). At this time <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-are-americans-adjusting-to-life-in-a-pandemic/">last week</a>, 43.4 percent approved and 52.6 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -9.2 points).

<p>In our average of polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/">generic congressional ballot</a>, Democrats currently lead by 7.7 percentage points (48.0 percent to 40.3 percent).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the presidential primary essentially settled, talk has already turned to who will be former Vice President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-time-for-another-2020-vice-presidential-draft/">running mate</a>. But if history is any guide, we won’t know the answer for a few months.</p>
<p>In the modern era of presidential nominations, which began when a number of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-selectionprocess-factbox/how-selecting-u-s-presidential-candidates-became-the-peoples-choice-idUSKCN0WW001">primary reforms were implemented in 1972</a>, the presumptive presidential nominee has never announced his or her vice presidential pick before July 6. And we could be waiting much longer than that: A few running mates haven’t been announced until late <i>August</i>.</p>

<p>But that wide date range obscures the fact that vice presidential candidate announcements are closely tied to the timing of the party conventions — which, of course, varies every election year. Four of the vice presidential nominees since 1972 were announced <i>at</i> the convention, and almost all the others were announced shortly before.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="7" href="#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;George McGovern&rsquo;s choice of Sargent Shriver in 1972 was a weird one; McGovern originally named Thomas Eagleton as his running mate at the convention, but Eagleton &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2012/08/04/157670201/the-thomas-eagleton-affair-haunts-candidates-today&quot;&gt;dropped off the ticket&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks later after it was revealed that he had been hospitalized for depression and had received electroshock treatment. McGovern &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/shriver-happy-and-very-proud-to-be-on-the-mcgovern-ticket.html&quot;&gt;announced Shriver as Eagleton&rsquo;s replacement&lt;/a&gt; 23 days after the convention ended.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-7">7</sup></a></p>
<p>For most of American history, vice presidential nominees were chosen during the conventions themselves, originally by the same chaotic, multiple-ballot process that was used to pick presidential nominees, but eventually at the direction of the presidential nominee, a trend that started with <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2016/07/how-running-mates-used-be-picked-and-when-they-were-announced/">Franklin D. Roosevelt choosing Henry Wallace in 1940</a>. And in 1984, Walter Mondale became the first presidential candidate to announce his running mate before the convention began (his pick, Geraldine Ferraro, also made history in another, more important way — she was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/13/us/geraldine-ferraro-chosen-mondale-running-mate-first-women-major-ticket.html">first woman on a major-party presidential ticket</a>).</p>
<p>Since then, the No. 2 spot on the ticket has almost always been announced the week before the convention, with the median vice presidential announcement occurring four days before the convention gavels in. However, there have been some exceptions to this pattern. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/06/kerry.vp/">John Kerry revealed John Edwards</a> as his choice on July 6, 2004 — 20 days before the Democratic convention — and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/mitt-romney-selects-paul-ryan-running-mate/story?id=16983499">Mitt Romney unveiled Paul Ryan</a> on Aug. 11, 2012 — 16 days before the Republican conference.</p>
<p>This (plus failed presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz’s stunt of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/04/27/475923611/ted-cruz-chooses-carly-fiorina-as-vice-presidential-pick">choosing businesswoman Carly Fiorina in 2016</a><a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="8" href="#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Fiorina is not included in the data above, for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-8">8</sup></a>) <i>could</i> suggest it’s becoming more common for candidates to announce their running mates weeks in advance. However, Cruz’s selection was seen as a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-cruz-fiorina-stunt-20160428-story.html">desperate ploy</a> to resurrect his sinking presidential campaign, and Romney’s was seen as an attempt to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/the-ticket/paul-ryan-help-mitt-romney-change-conversation-081857178.html">change the narrative</a> amid a bad news cycle, so we should probably still only expect early announcements in limited circumstances. (And considering that Biden is leading Trump in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/">most early polls</a>, he does not fit the historical mold of a candidate who needs to announce his choice early.)</p>
<p>At one point, we probably could have expected Biden’s announcement in early July, shortly before the Democratic National Convention kicked off on July 13. But the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/milwaukee-democratic-convention-delayed.html">coronavirus-related delay of the convention</a> to the week of Aug. 17 probably also pushed back the timing of the veep pick. If Biden follows the pattern of past nominees, we can probably expect to learn the identity of his running mate the week of Aug. 10. And if you’re trying to plan when exactly to <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/boston-janesville-robert-costa/">track airplanes</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/betsy_klein/status/756514211233140736?s=20">monitor finalists’ every move</a>, might I recommend Friday, Aug. 14? The last five vice presidential picks have all been announced either the Friday before the convention or early that Saturday morning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coronavirus pandemic has raised a host of new questions about the 2020 election. What will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-states-with-lockdown-protests-been-hit-harder-by-unemployment/">the economy look like in November</a>? How do voters think President Trump is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/?ex_cid=rrpromo">handling the crisis</a>? How will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-coronavirus-could-change-how-we-vote-in-2020-and-beyond/">Americans physically cast their votes</a>? And could the current moment be so extraordinary that it outweighs partisanship and causes Republican voters to abandon Trump in November?</p>
<p>For the last question, at least, we can look to history for some clues. The 2008 election isn’t exactly parallel to our current situation, but there were some similarities. Back then, an unpopular Republican president, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/">George W. Bush</a>, sat in the White House <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/2008-financial-crisis-3305679">amid an economic disaster</a>, though he wasn’t running for reelection. But the environment that GOP nominee Sen. John McCain was running in may be not unlike the one Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/us/politics/trump-election-briefings.html">faces in 2020</a>. (One important caveat: When McCain ran, the GOP had already held the presidency for two terms, and historically, it’s rare for the same party to <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/historic-re-election-pattern-doesnt-favor-democrats-in-2016">win three times in a row</a>. Conversely, it’s <a href="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcampbel/documents/Elect2012ForumFinal_001.pdf">very common</a> for incumbent presidents like Trump to win a second term.)</p>
<p>The 2008 election resulted in a Democratic landslide, as then-Sen. Barack Obama defeated McCain by about 7 percentage points in the national popular vote. Considering how polarized our politics are, this was a large victory <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-blowout-presidential-elections-a-thing-of-the-past/">by modern standards</a>, as the chart below shows.</p>
<figure id="attachment_271270" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-271270" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Skelley-McCain-Trump-0429-copy.png" alt="" width="575" height="670" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Skelley-McCain-Trump-0429-copy.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Skelley-McCain-Trump-0429-copy.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>Democrats didn’t just take the White House either. They also made huge gains in the Senate and House of Representatives, adding to their majorities in both chambers.</p>
<p>But Democrats didn’t win because Republicans were fleeing the party or voting for the Democrat en masse &#8212; McCain still won support from most Republicans who turned out that year. The 2008 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a massive survey that asks Americans about their politics and voting habits, found that McCain won 95 percent of self-identified Republicans who voted, as well as 90 percent of independents who leaned Republican. Similarly, Obama won the overwhelming majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (92 and 93 percent).<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="9" href="#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;The 2008 CCES figures are based on validated voters. Because Virginia voters could not be validated at the time, that state was excluded from this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-9">9</sup></a> This partisan split <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/independent-voters-partisans-in-the-closet-101931">is in line with results</a> from other recent presidential elections, too.</p>
<p>The difference in 2008 was the makeup of the electorate: 51 percent of voters identified as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents while 41 percent identified as Republicans or Republican-leaning, according to CCES data.</p>
<p>Some of this was because <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-5705.2010.03757.x">Democratic identification</a> more or less <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/274694/party-preferences-steady-during-trump-era.aspx">peaked in 2008</a> while Republican identification was at a low point. Democrats also saw strong turnout from Democratic-leaning demographic groups like African Americans, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/us/politics/21vote.html">showed up in historic numbers to vote for America’s first black president</a>. And getting those partisans to the ballot box was vital to Obama’s victory, as he actually lost among “pure” independents, or those who didn’t lean toward either party, by 11 percentage points. Fortunately, for Obama, true independents only made up about 7 percent of the total electorate.</p>
<p>Of course, we don’t know how many votes McCain might have lost because people abandoned the GOP <i>before</i> the election or because some Republicans simply didn’t show up to vote. Corwin Smidt, a political scientist at Michigan State University, told me that it’s likely that some people switched parties because of the financial crisis or the Iraq War, but he said it was probably a fairly small share of the electorate. One study estimated that Obama may have <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8344/49e630769429e703cdae58feeda44fcbdb94.pdf">won 15 percent of voters</a> who said they backed George W. Bush in 2004.</p>
<p>Smidt told me he thought we could see some people switch parties here in 2020, though, with some Republicans leaving the party because of the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. In fact, there is some evidence that a small share of voters have already shifted parties during the Trump presidency. In 2017, the <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2017/05/17/partisan-identification-is-sticky-but-about-10-switched-parties-over-the-past-year/">Pew Research Center found</a> that roughly one-tenth of Democrats and Republicans (including those who leaned toward one party) defected to the other party over the course of the 2016 campaign and in the early days of Trump’s presidency. But Smidt cautioned that we’re still likely only talking about a small slice of the electorate who might switch parties in 2020 <a href="https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2019/6/21/18679314/trump-support-is-not-normal-partisanship">because Trump is so polarizing</a> and <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2019/10/10/the-partisan-landscape-and-views-of-the-parties/">there is such a gulf between Democrats and Republicans</a> on most political issues. “If party differences are clear, people are less likely to switch,” said Smidt. And right now, he says, “It is hard for people to switch.”</p>
<p>Studies have shown that partisans are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12218">more likely to stick with their party</a> now than they were just a few years ago, and people <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2019/10/10/partisan-antipathy-more-intense-more-personal/">feel more negatively than ever</a> toward members of the other party. Surveys also suggest that the overall share of people who identify with or lean toward each party <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/274694/party-preferences-steady-during-trump-era.aspx">has been relatively stable</a>. So that means Trump’s intraparty support may be just as strong as McCain’s was in 2008. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-economy-still-the-most-important-thing-for-trumps-reelection/">His approval rating has been remarkably steady</a>, and he’s enjoyed very strong Republican backing throughout his presidency, with as many as 91 percent of Republicans and 89 percent of Republican leaners approving of his job performance before the 2018 midterm elections, according to CCES data for registered voters.</p>
<p>There’s little sign that Republicans are backing away from Trump either. A <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/03/26/views-of-how-officials-public-have-responded-to-covid-19/">late March poll from Pew</a> found that, among registered voters,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="10" href="#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Based on self-reported registration status.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-10">10</sup></a> 92 percent of Republicans approved of Trump, as did 79 percent of independents who leaned Republican. While the approval among leaners may seem low compared to the 2018 CCES data, it was actually similar to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/01/trumps-approval-ratings-so-far-are-unusually-stable-and-deeply-partisan/">previous Pew polls</a> that found 70 to 75 percent of Republican leaners approved of Trump.</p>
<p>So just like McCain in 2008, Trump likely still has very strong backing from Republicans that will almost certainly hold up even if things go poorly for him in the coming months. What we can’t know, of course, is just how much a bad economy might move people away from the GOP before the election, or how many partisans might simply stay home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/">weekly politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>
<div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div>

<p><b>sarahf </b>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): You may have thought that with former Vice President Joe Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee our 2020 drafts were finally over. Well, no such luck. There’s still the question of whom Biden will pick as his vice president. We know thanks to his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/15/politics/joe-biden-woman-vice-president/index.html">announcement at an earlier presidential debate</a> that he plans to pick a female running mate, but that’s it.</p>
<p>So we’re back with a <a href="http://www.playdailyfantasysports.com/what-is-a-snake-draft/">snake draft</a> of whom Biden should pick for his VP. How it works is simple: Three rounds total, so between the three of us, nine potential 2020 Democratic veeps. And the draft line up is …</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Nathaniel</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Sarah</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Geoffrey</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, you’re up, Nathaniel.</p>
<p><b>nrakich </b>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, elections analyst): Ahhh, I wanted the second pick.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley </b>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst)<b>: </b>Hahaha, really?</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah — I think there are two equally strong contenders for the first overall pick. But I will go for the more obvious one: Sen. Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Harris obviously ran for president already, which means she&#8217;s been vetted. She has also long been considered a rising star in the party. Plus, she would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/joe-biden-vice-president-black-candidates.html">make history</a> as both the first African American and first Asian American vice president, and African American voters are probably a group that Biden should reach out to given that he won the nomination <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/joe-biden-owes-it-all-to-african-american-voters.html">thanks largely to their support</a>. And this goes without saying, but Democrats will want to try to get African American turnout in the general election closer to where it was for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/12/4-4-million-2012-obama-voters-stayed-home-in-2016-more-than-a-third-of-them-black/">former President Barack Obama</a> than where it was for Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>There will inevitably be some &#8220;ooh, remember how they <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/27/harris-attacks-bidens-record-on-busing-and-working-with-segregationists.html">attacked each other in that first primary debate</a>&#8221; chatter, but I think that moment is overblown. Harris was doing what she had to do to win. And both before and after that incident, Biden and Harris have reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-endorsement.html">gotten along quite well</a>.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Some say the first rule of vice presidential selection is to &#8220;do no harm,&#8221; and Harris would probably fit that bill on a number of fronts. She&#8217;s been in the spotlight and vetted as a former presidential candidate, as Nathaniel said. In other words, she&#8217;d meet the &#8220;Ready on Day 1&#8221; test that I think is pretty key for Biden.</p>
<p>Additionally, California isn’t a swing state, but Harris’s Senate seat would likely remain in Democratic hands. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom would appoint her replacement and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_III.htm">when her seat is up in 2022</a>, Democrats would be very likely to hold onto it.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, I think the <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2012/07/politically-veepstakes-isnt-worth.html">home-state effect of vice-presidential candidates</a> is slim to none. That&#8217;s going to inform a lot of my picks.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>In their <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/28/biden-vice-president-2020-elections-212555">veepstakes feature</a> on Tuesday, Politico set up Biden&#8217;s VP decision as a choice between appealing to black voters and appealing to the progressive wing of the party. So if he were to select Harris &#8212; whom I agree does seem like a very solid pick for him &#8212; I guess that only checks one of those boxes. But arguably, it’s not really possible for Biden to check both boxes with one VP.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>I think the Biden campaign would argue Harris gives them some of both &#8212; she is a cosponsor on Sen. Bernie Sanders&#8217;s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1129/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded&amp;KWICView=false">Medicare for All legislation,</a> for instance.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>That’s true, but I still think about how she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/upshot/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all-debate.html">infamously raised her hand</a> in one of the early debates to say she supported Medicare for All, only to walk that back later.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, one downside to Harris is that the progressive wing of the party doesn&#8217;t really trust her. (Think of the &#8220;<a href="https://theslot.jezebel.com/did-the-kamala-is-a-cop-meme-help-tank-harriss-campaign-1840056843">Kamala is a cop</a>&#8221; meme.) But I agree, it&#8217;s hard to appeal to both, and I think African Americans are the more important constituency for Biden.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>Well, and to the point you raised initially, Nathaniel, Biden won the nomination thanks in large part to black Democrats&#8217; support &#8212; think South Carolina in particular &#8212; so it&#8217;s hard to not think that is a major consideration for Biden when weighing options.</p>
<p>But OK, I&#8217;m up. Ugh. At least I don&#8217;t have to go last in this draft.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Sigh.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>So I&#8217;m not totally sure I agree with my own pick, but if part of the optics around Biden&#8217;s VP pick requires appealing to black voters or progressive voters, I wonder if he can&#8217;t try and do both by picking Rep. Ayanna Pressley.</p>
<p>I know Sen. Elizabeth Warren would be a more natural, high-profile pick to represent the progressive wing of the party, especially considering she ran for president, and Pressley is only a one-term House representative, but I’d argue Pressley, like fellow Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, represents <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-squad-v-pelosi-be-a-big-problem-for-democrats-in-2020/">a new direction for the party</a>, which I think is an important characteristic for Biden&#8217;s VP to have.</p>
<p>I suppose that Pressley’s lack of experience is what hurts her chances to be Biden’s running mate the most. Massachusetts isn&#8217;t exactly a swing state either.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Bold pick! Although I have learned the hard way <a href="https://twitter.com/mayasweedler/status/1166827013711249408?s=20">not to bet against Sarah</a> in these drafts&#8230;</p>
<p>I think Pressley is an interesting choice, but ultimately, I think the lack of experience dooms her. Biden, at 77, is the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-if-a-presidential-nominee-can-no-longer-run-for-office/">oldest major-party presidential nominee ever</a>. That means the top consideration for the Biden campaign should be picking someone who will be ready to become president on day one.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Yeah, Pressley is fascinating, and it&#8217;s no coincidence that her name popped up in discussions about <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/darrensands/massachusetts-democrats-kennedy-ayanna-pressley-markey">what might happen to Warren&#8217;s Senate seat</a> if Warren had won the nomination (or maybe the vice presidency, still). But I agree with Nathaniel that Biden is unlikely to pick a one-term House member.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a rising star, but maybe the 2020 election is just too near.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>The lack of experience definitely cuts against Pressley. But if Biden’s top VP considerations are appealing to black and progressive voters, I think it’s impressive she can check both boxes. I also thought she was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/ayanna-pressley-endorses-elizabeth-warren.html">pretty effective endorser of Warren</a> in the primary, but yeah, I admit that I’m not convinced this will actually happen.</p>
<p>OK, you&#8217;re up Geoffrey!!</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Alright, I think my first pick is a bit predictable, but she would obviously fit in nicely with Biden&#8217;s political outlook: Sen. Amy Klobuchar.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Oh, bad pick.</p>
<p>Maybe my alternative first choice will still be on the board after all&#8230;</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>She ran for president and has a long history of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/amy-klobuchar-2020-democratic-nomination-kickoff/">doing well in a purple state</a>. Plus, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/02/klobuchar-to-drop-out-of-2020-campaign-endorse-biden-118823">she endorsed Biden</a> right after dropping out of the Democratic presidential primary, so that may have also nicely positioned her for consideration.</p>
<p>And again, if the idea is to do no harm, she&#8217;s a fairly safe choice. But whereas I can see some progressives coming around to Harris, it&#8217;s harder to see that happening with Klobuchar.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think that after Harris, she&#8217;s probably the second-most-likely senator to get picked.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>That&#8217;s true, Geoffrey, I don’t see progressives warming up to Klobuchar like they might with Harris. In some ways, picking Klobuchar would be Biden doubling down on his base &#8212; i.e., appealing to more moderate voters, right?</p>
<p>Why do you say, bad pick, Nathaniel?</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I just don&#8217;t see what Klobuchar adds. She is incredibly redundant with Biden in terms of ideology and appeal to swing voters. Biden should try to pick someone who appeals to a different constituency.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>There&#8217;s a chance Biden will view that redundancy as a good thing, though.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I’m also not sure that Klobuchar wouldn&#8217;t do any harm &#8230; While I could see the left grumbling about, but ultimately accepting, Harris, I think they would be much more actively opposed to Klobuchar, who was always toward the center of the Democratic presidential field.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>That’s fair, but at the same time, I suspect Klobuchar wouldn&#8217;t turn off some of the voters in the middle the way Harris might.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Also, it’s not necessarily a dealbreaker in the same way it would be for some other potential VP picks (cough Tammy Baldwin cough), but if Klobuchar resigns from the Senate, her seat would go to a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vacancies-in-the-united-states-senate.aspx">special election in November 2022</a>, two years ahead of schedule, putting a Senate seat unnecessarily in danger.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>But that&#8217;s a concern with almost every senator outside of Harris!</p>
<p>Democrats have a fairly deep bench in Minnesota, too, so that might not be that risky of a move.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Hm, I disagree there. Other senators are on different schedules or hail from bluer states than Minnesota.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Out of the people likely to get picked, though?</p>
<p>Maybe Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Shhh, spoilers!</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Lol, the Senate special election discussion could take up half the chat.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Was that not the plan??</p>
<p>In all seriousness, though, it&#8217;s a <i>very</i> important factor in the veepstakes discussion. A President Biden would need every Democratic vote in the Senate he can muster to pass his agenda.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>That’s a good point, but OK &#8212; you&#8217;re up again, Geoffrey.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>My next pick is Sen. Tammy Duckworth. The Illinois senator flies a little under the radar, but she&#8217;s got <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/tammy-duckworth-interview-vogue-october-2018-issue">a fascinating background</a> as an Asian American veteran who lost both her legs as a helicopter pilot fighting in Iraq. She&#8217;s also from a blue state, so her seat would be more likely to remain in Democratic hands (it&#8217;s up in 2022).</p>
<p>However, as 2010 showed, weird things can happen &#8212; the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/us/politics/03illinois.html">GOP captured this very same seat</a> that year, formerly held by Obama, so it&#8217;s worth noting that Illinois isn&#8217;t California.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Ah, dammit. Duckworth was my second choice. She would be a great pick, for all the reasons Geoffrey says.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>She also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-birth.html">gave birth while in office</a>, the first senator to do so!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just a lot to her story that I could see winning the Biden campaign over.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, she has a great story to tell, on many different dimensions.</p>
<p>And her low national name recognition right now could be seen as a reason not to pick her, but it&#8217;s also an opportunity.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>Right, I mean it&#8217;s not like Sen. Tim Kaine had a huge national profile prior to when Clinton picked him in 2016.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, I think people generally overrate people who ran for president and lost when thinking about veep contenders.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Yeah, honestly the main reason I picked Klobuchar ahead of Duckworth was Klobuchar ran for president and has more of a national profile. But Duckworth might be the better pick &#8212; it&#8217;s less clear that she would offend any part of the Democratic coalition.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>OK, let&#8217;s see. It undercuts my first pick (Pressley), but I also think Warren would be interesting. Clearly, I have a Massachusetts bias.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Massachusetts bias is nothing to be ashamed of, Sarah.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>But assuming national profile matters somewhat in who a candidate picks for VP (to be clear, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-biden-choose-a-running-mate-based-on-electability-ideology-or-identity/">political science</a> on this isn&#8217;t really clear, but it does seem to matter to party elites), Warren has got that covered. And apparently, when Biden was still considering running in 2016, he wanted <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-223104">Warren as his running mate</a>! That&#8217;s interesting to me, considering the visible bad blood between the two during the debates (thinking about their heated exchange over <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-democratic-presidential-debate">who deserves credit for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>).</p>
<p>What Warren would bring to the ticket is an ideological balance that I think few other candidates could give Biden, but I could also see her being a potential general election risk for Biden. I&#8217;m also not sure if the other constituency she appeals to &#8212; college-educated whites &#8212; is where Biden needs the most help?</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Warren would certainly meet the Ready on Day 1 test, plus she&#8217;d unify the party pretty well. I do wonder if she&#8217;s a case where the Biden campaign might be concerned that the VP pick outshines the presidential nominee. That’s on top of the concerns that her progressive views might alienate some in the middle.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, Warren was also pretty high on my board. If you decide your goal is to appeal to progressives, there&#8217;s no better choice (other than, I guess, Sen. Bernie Sanders, although that isn&#8217;t going to happen for many reasons). She has the experience to be president and demonstrated that she has a loyal following with her strong presidential campaign.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>That’s true, but there is still the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/youll-never-know-which-candidate-is-electable/">always-thorny electability question</a> about whether Warren’s progressive positions would harm Biden&#8217;s attempts to have a broader appeal.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, I wonder how that would play, Geoffrey. In this age of polarization, it&#8217;s debatable whether a presidential nominee on the ideological extremes <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330565898_Man_Bites_Blue_Dog_Are_Moderates_Really_More_Electable_than_Ideologues">still puts the ticket at a disadvantage</a>; would a vice-presidential nominee on the extremes do the same thing? I&#8217;m not so sure.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>I will say that a Warren pick would be interesting in that, at 71 years old by Election Day, Warren would be less likely to end up running for president should Biden win, so the VP pick wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be a launch pad for the next presidential contender.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Eh, I don&#8217;t know, she could probably run in 2024 if she wanted. (I think there&#8217;s a strong possibility that Biden would not run for a second term.)</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>That&#8217;s true, but with most of these other names, the VP would very likely run in the future if the ticket won &#8212; or even if it didn’t. But we’re probably getting a little ahead of ourselves here.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>OK, Nathaniel, you&#8217;re up with your second and third picks!</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>OK, next on my list is Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. She has risen quickly in the Senate ranks; though she was just elected in 2016, she has already become chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. (I guess you could ding her for being inexperienced, but she was also state attorney general for two terms before that — in other words, she&#8217;s as experienced as Harris.) And, as a Latina, she would bring some racial diversity to the ticket, although I don’t want to imply that means she will automatically boost the ticket with Latino voters. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-sanders-may-start-losing-more-latino-voters-to-biden/">Latinos are not a uniform group</a>, and picking a Mexican American woman from the West wouldn’t necessarily resonate with, say, Cuban American voters in Florida.</p>
<p>(And, for you Senate special-election nerds, Cortez Masto&#8217;s seat will be up for election in 2022 regardless, so the only difference will be whether it is an open seat or not.)</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Definitely a good pick. She&#8217;s under the radar, sort of like Duckworth, but has a very strong resume and a history-making backstory.</p>
<p>But with the Senate stuff, you wonder if the Biden team&#8217;s mindset is, &#8216;Look, we&#8217;ll probably lose the Senate in 2022 even if <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-checking-in-on-all-those-2020-senate-races-a-few-gop-incumbents-look-vulnerable/">Democrats overcome a tough map</a> to narrowly gain control of it in 2020, so we should make the best pick regardless of what that means for the Senate.&#8217;</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, maybe. But there is definitely a downside to picking someone like Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who I suspect will go unchosen in this draft. Baldwin&#8217;s seat would go immediately to a special election in 2021, and Wisconsin of course is a purple-to-light-red state. So that would cripple Democrats&#8217; hypothetical Senate majority almost right away.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>That&#8217;s a good pick, Nathaniel, and could be a good way for Biden to broaden his base, considering his struggle to win the Latino vote in Nevada relative to Sanders. Although, of course, that has its limitations. What do we know about Cortez Masto&#8217;s politics, though? Isn’t she more of a moderate Democrat?</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>According to VoteView.com&#8217;s ideological scoring, she&#8217;s more or less around <a href="https://voteview.com/person/41700/catherine-marie-cortez-masto">the middle of the Democratic Party</a>, <i>maybe</i> slightly to the left of it.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I think because she is unknown to many voters, she (and/or Biden) could define her ideology however they want, which I think is a plus. (Although she is a member of the establishment, as evidenced by her leadership of the DSCC.)</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>OK, last round &#8212; take us away, Nathaniel.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>For my last pick, I&#8217;ll go with New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. She&#8217;s arguably the best pick among Democratic governors, many of whom were just elected in 2018 and therefore aren&#8217;t that experienced. However, Lujan Grisham also served six years in the House of Representatives, so I think her combined experience passes the bar. Plus, as a Latina, she is Democrats&#8217; only nonwhite woman governor.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>I was wondering if we were going to get around to including any governors in this draft!</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>I think some folks may be surprised she was the first governor taken!</p>
<p>But agreed, she has an experience level that surpasses some other newly-elected 2018 governors.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, even though many governors are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-like-how-their-governor-is-handling-the-coronavirus-outbreak/">getting high marks for how they’re handling the coronavirus crisis</a> right now, Democrats&#8217; gubernatorial bench is just pretty weak thanks to their drubbings in the 2010 and 2014 midterms. Plus, Democrats really love picking senators as running mates — <a href="http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/applying-conventional-criteria-to-bidens-unconventional-vice-presidential-pool/">15 of the last 18 Democratic vice-presidential candidates</a> have been senators!</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>Is that some foreshadowing of your last pick, Geoffrey?</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>I guess that may depend on what you do, Sarah!</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>So for my last pick, I&#8217;m going to go with Stacey Abrams. Working against her is the fact that she probably has the least amount of government experience of all the picks named. Yes, she was a Georgia state representative for 10 years, but she isn’t currently a public official. That said, her 2018 gubernatorial bid against Gov. Brian Kemp <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/georgia-governor">was close</a>, which is impressive in a red state like Georgia.</p>
<p>It’s a testament to how skilled of a politician she is too, considering she&#8217;s been able to stay in the national conversation, even though she&#8217;s not currently in office. The way she’s breaking the (unspoken) rules by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/26/stacey-abrams-joe-biden-vice-president-209352">actively campaigning for VP</a> is fascinating to watch, too. She had this powerful line in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/26/21237468/stacey-abrams-why-should-be-biden-vp-pick">a recent interview</a> where she explained her decision to push for the job, saying, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t raise your hand, people won&#8217;t see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I understand how her outspoken desire for the job will be portrayed as a power-hungry move and alienate some in the party because it violates the norms around how nominees pick their running mates, but I could also see that drive resonating with a lot of voters.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, Sarah, I’m also fascinated to see where her unorthodox strategy of campaigning for the job leads. But ultimately, I think Abrams would be a bad pick for Biden because there would be lots of questions about whether she is prepared to step into the role of president.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>&#8220;Unorthodox&#8221; is the right word &#8212; it&#8217;s atypical for someone to actively seek the vice presidency in the press.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I could see it rubbing a lot of people the wrong way, but also, I think there would be a racial and gendered element to any criticism. Would a white man be criticized for being outspoken about his ambitions?</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>Exactly, Nathaniel, that&#8217;s why I think it&#8217;s so interesting to see Abrams campaign for the job in this way. You&#8217;re right that it probably does irritate some party veterans, but I think it&#8217;s a powerful message that could resonate with a lot of rank-and-file voters.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Abrams could be an energizing force for Biden’s campaign, too. She&#8217;s only 46 and has such a strong profile built off her narrow loss in the 2018 gubernatorial race in Georgia. Maybe there&#8217;s a case that she helps Biden with black voters and younger ones whom Biden didn&#8217;t do as well with during the primary.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>True. But OK, Geoffrey, take us home! Last pick!</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Alright, for my last pick, I was a bit torn because there are a fair number of directions I could see the Biden campaign going. But I&#8217;ll pick &#8220;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/09/gretchen-whitmer-governor-michigan-profile-2020-coronavirus-biden-vp-177791">that woman in Michigan</a>&#8221; &#8212; Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Her experience level is a question mark &#8212; she only won her office in 2018. But she&#8217;s had a lengthy political career in Michigan, and if her <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michiganders-approve-of-whitmer-on-coronavirus-despite-protests-poll-2020-4">approval holds up</a> on her handling of the coronavirus crisis despite becoming a national political figure, maybe that strengthens her resume enough.</p>
<p>While I, too, am skeptical of there being a significant home-state benefit to vice-presidential picks, Whitmer is from Michigan, a state Trump very narrowly carried in 2016. And more broadly, she might serve Biden well in the region as a whole. She&#8217;s also only 48 years old, making her one of the younger possibilities we&#8217;ve mentioned today. That could give the ticket a nice generational balance.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, on the experience front, I dunno&#8230; She might get a pass from the media or low-information voters because she&#8217;s been governor during this time of crisis. And she was the Democratic leader in the Michigan Senate, which isn&#8217;t nothing. But I just don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s enough to be prepared to be leader of the free world.</p>
<p>Her handling of the coronavirus crisis may not be the selling point that many analysts assume it is either. She got in trouble recently for giving a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michigan-cancels-contract-with-two-democratic-linked-firms-that-had-been-tapped-to-track-coronavirus/2020/04/21/161a23ce-8413-11ea-ae26-989cfce1c7c7_story.html">no-bid state contract</a> for tracking coronavirus cases to Democratic-connected firms. That&#8217;s the kind of rookie mistake that comes with inexperience.</p>
<p>Plus, how would it look for her to take a leave of absence from the governorship amid a pandemic to go campaign?</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>One other thing that’s been weighing on me as we&#8217;ve chatted about Biden’s potential VPs is the kind of weird place we find ourselves in. On the one hand, we know Biden is going to pick a woman, but we just don’t know who.</p>
<p>And that’s complicated because whomever Biden picks, she&#8217;ll be tasked with defending his alleged track record with women, which is daunting &#8212; there&#8217;s the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/joe-biden-accuser-accusations-allegations.html">inappropriate touching claims</a> from earlier in 2019 and now former Biden staffer Tara Reade has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html">accused Biden of sexual assault</a>. That&#8217;s something that his VP, especially because she will be a woman, will have to speak to no matter who she is.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, I’ll be watching how these latest allegations play out.</p>
<p>For whatever reason — no room in the coronavirus news cycle? media bias? Trump and Republicans aren&#8217;t harping on it? — Reade&#8217;s allegations haven&#8217;t gotten a lot of traction yet. But with Business Insider finding someone whom Reade <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-neighbor-corroborates-joe-bidens-accuser-2020-4">told about the alleged assault</a> at the time, it seems like they aren&#8217;t going away either.</p>
<p>So far, though, female politicians (not that women are the only ones who care about this issue), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/leading-democrats-stand-behind-biden-after-sexual-assault-allegation-11588092623">including some we mentioned in this chat</a>, are still supporting Biden, or at least aren&#8217;t saying anything about the accusations. Hillary Clinton even <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/28/hillary-clinton-endorse-joe-biden-president/3040742001/">endorsed Biden</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p><b>sarahf:</b> Yeah, it’s hard at this point to say how this will all shake out for Biden. If more women step forward or if we get more corroboration around Reade’s allegations, I have to think this causes Biden serious trouble. But even if that doesn’t happen, whoever Biden’s VP is will have to talk about his relationship with women, and as Rebecca Traister wrote for New York Magazine, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/04/the-biden-trap-woman-vice-president.html">that might be a hard pill to swallow</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Depending on who you listen to, you might hear one of two very different narratives about former Vice President Joe Biden. One says he’s a strong candidate: He <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/23/polls-biden-leads-trump-wisconsin-michigan-pennsylvania-florida/3012071001/">leads President Trump</a> in most early polls, his folksy demeanor will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/us/politics/joe-biden-working-class.html">win back working-class white voters</a>, and he’s moderate enough to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/suburbanites-are-backing-biden/607726/">attract ex-Republicans in the suburbs</a>. The other says he’s a weak one: He’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/12/its-fair-speculate-whether-biden-is-mentally-fit-be-president/">gaffe-prone</a>, his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/24/obama-clinton-donors-biden-fundraising-056246">fundraising has been anemic</a> and he’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/joe-biden-campaign-coronavirus">been absent from the public eye</a> during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In reality, it’s <a href="https://www.insideelections.com/news/article/good-candidate-bad-candidate-who-knows">hard to tell whether a candidate is strong or weak</a> without knowing how he actually performs in the election. But one thing we <i>can</i> do is place Biden in the context of Democrats’ previous presidential nominees. So we picked four easily quantifiable, objective barometers of electoral prowess — primary performance, favorability, endorsements and fundraising — and calculated them for the past seven nonincumbent Democratic presidential nominees: Walter Mondale in 1984, Michael Dukakis in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992, Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004, Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Then we checked how Biden measures up.</p>
<h2><b>Primary performance</b></h2>
<p>Let’s start with the most elemental metric of all — the share of the popular vote each nominee received in the primaries. (This is a useful proxy for how united Democratic voters were behind the candidate heading into the general election.) To keep things fair, let’s look at what percentage of the national vote each candidate had received at the time that he or she became the presumptive Democratic nominee<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="11" href="#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;For Mondale, Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Obama and Hillary Clinton, this was the date they mathematically clinched the nomination. For Gore, Kerry and Biden, it was the day their last serious rival dropped out. What constitutes a &ldquo;serious rival&rdquo; and &ldquo;dropping out&rdquo; is admittedly a bit subjective in some cases, but we&rsquo;ve chosen to define the former as someone the media treated as a non-fringe candidate (so not Al Sharpton or Dennis Kucinich in 2004) and the latter as formally withdrawing or suspending one&rsquo;s campaign (so Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/28/us/jackson-campaign-chastened-by-recent-primary-defeats-revises-its-goal.html&quot;&gt;shift in tone&lt;/a&gt; in 1988 doesn&rsquo;t count). &lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-11">11</sup></a> to see who crossed the finish line in the best position (otherwise, the numbers for past candidates would be inflated by all the contests they won unopposed). We also excluded caucuses from these calculations, since caucus states often did not release popular-vote totals.</p>

<p>With 42 percent of the primary popular vote won so far, Biden ranks toward the bottom of the list of recent Democratic nominees. Only Mondale, who’d won 38 percent of the popular vote when he became the presumptive nominee, went to the general election with a smaller share of the primary vote — not a great place to be in considering that Mondale <a href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1984">got crushed</a> in November 1984. Of course, Biden also faced a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everyones-running-and-that-could-be-dangerous-for-the-democrats/">historically large field of opponents</a>, whereas Gore and Hillary Clinton — the Democrats with the strongest primary performances — faced only one serious rival, making it easier for them to capture primary majorities. (That said, the fact that they were largely able to clear the field and Biden was not suggests something about the perceived strength of each of those candidates.) Notably, though, Gore and Clinton also lost their general elections (although they did win the popular vote), so this may not be a very telling metric.</p>
<p>However, just because many Democrats voted for someone else in the primary doesn’t mean they won’t come around to the nominee by the convention. Shortly before the 2008 and 2016 Democratic National Conventions, both Obama and Hillary Clinton were viewed favorably by an overwhelming majority of Democrats — far more than the share who voted for them in the primary. According to national polls by Quinnipiac University, 77 percent of Democrats in 2008 had a <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=1204">positive opinion of Obama</a> compared to only 10 percent with an unfavorable view, and Democrats in 2016 had a strongly positive opinion of Clinton, <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2363">81 percent favorable to 12 percent unfavorable</a>. In other words, it’s a bit premature at this point to say that Biden has an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/so-about-that-supposed-lack-of-enthusiasm-for-biden/">intraparty problem</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Overall favorability</b></h2>
<p>Of course, the Democrats are only a fraction of the electorate that passes judgment on nominees in November, so it’s also worth asking what the American public <i>as a whole</i> thought about the nominee at this point in the campaign. (Popularity can change, of course, but this will give us a sense of where Biden is starting relative to his predecessors.) Let’s compare the eight candidates’ favorable and unfavorable ratings in national polls conducted the month after they became the presumptive nominee.</p>

<p>In terms of net favorability (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating), Biden is right in the middle of the pack — about the same share of Americans like him as dislike him. But Biden is also one of the best-known Democratic nominees of the last 36 years. In total, 91 percent of Americans have some opinion of him, positive or negative, basically tying him with Obama on that measure and trailing the leader among recent nominees, Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>This is important because it means people would have to change their minds about Biden to meaningfully affect his approval rating. In other words, there aren’t a lot of people left on whom he could make a favorable first impression — but on the other hand, nor is there a lot of room for his opponents to define him. That was the danger Dukakis faced in 1988, when he became the presumptive nominee with a fantastic +28 net favorability rating — but only 67 percent of Americans had formed an opinion of him. By November, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/06/us/bush-still-ahead-as-end-nears-but-dukakis-gains-in-survey.html">CBS News/New York Times polling</a> was giving him a negative net favorability rating.</p>
<p>Among recent Democratic presidential nominees, Obama in 2008 was in the most enviable position in terms of likeability: 93 percent of Americans had an opinion of him, and that opinion was overwhelmingly positive (a +20 net favorability rating). Hillary Clinton was in the worst position: Almost everyone in the country had an opinion of her, and they really disliked her (a -15 net favorability rating). Biden is well known but has a net favorability rating in between the two, so it’s hard to be either optimistic or pessimistic about his candidacy.</p>
<h2><b>Endorsements</b></h2>
<p>Another way to assess a candidate’s strength is to see how much support he or she had with party leaders at this point in the race. To grade each nominee on this dimension, we counted up the number of endorsements he or she had received from sitting governors, U.S. senators and U.S. representatives before sewing up the nomination. To account for the fact that some endorsements are more valuable than others, we combined them into a single metric: “endorsement points.” We weighted the endorsements the same way we did <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/">in 2016</a>: A governor’s endorsement is worth 10 endorsement points, a senator’s is worth 5 and a representative’s is worth 1.</p>

<p>Again, Biden’s intraparty support is underwhelming: He has the second-fewest endorsement points among modern Democratic nominees — just barely ahead of Kerry. Eventual presidents like Obama and Bill Clinton did a better job convincing their colleagues to endorse them; however, the Democrats with the most endorsement points were once again Hillary Clinton and Gore, and it didn’t do them much good.</p>
<h2><b>Fundraising</b></h2>
<p>Finally, let’s compare the candidates’ finances. Their cash on hand at the time they became the presumptive nominee<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="12" href="#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Using the first Federal Election Commission report they filed after that date. However, because Biden became the presumptive nominee less than three weeks ago and has not filed a fundraising report since, we just used his most recent report, which runs through March 31.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-12">12</sup></a> tells us how much money they started the general election with; the amount they raised from individual contributions hints at their fundraising ability. To control for the fact that the candidates all kicked off their campaigns and became the presumptive nominee on different dates, we converted their individual contributions into a rate — amount raised per 30 days &#8212; so we could compare how fast they raised money over the course of the campaign.

<p>Biden is raising money at a decent pace by the standards of past Democratic nominees, but it’s important to consider how modern fundraising is easier than ever. Even adjusted for inflation, more recent nominees raised money at far faster clips and had much more cash in their coffers than nominees from earlier cycles. The proliferation of the internet now means that candidates can raise money from anyone, anywhere in the country, at any time, instead of having to rely on personally glad-handing elite donors. These days, small donors giving through services like ActBlue have become the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-actblue-is-trying-to-turn-small-donations-into-a-blue-wave/">dominant source of Democratic campaign cash</a>.</p>
<p>So it’s hardly surprising that Biden has more cash on hand than Mondale and Dukakis, and no one should be citing the fact that he’s outraised Bill Clinton as a reason that he’ll outperform Clinton electorally. In fact, by modern standards, Biden has been a comparatively weak fundraiser, raising nearly $5 million less per month than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. He also has less than two-thirds of what Kerry had in the bank going into the 2004 general election. That said, no one should feel bad about failing to match Obama’s extraordinary fundraising numbers. Thanks to his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/17/barackobama.uselections2008">strength with grassroots donors</a>, he raised (after adjusting for inflation) $22.8 million a month during the 2008 primary and entered the general election with a whopping $85.9 million on hand.</p>
<div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div>

<p>OK! Now that we’ve graded Biden on four fronts, how does his report card look overall? These yardsticks, at least, suggest that he is indeed a weak Democratic presidential nominee by historical standards; he’s below average on everything except fundraising, and even that comes with a big asterisk attached.</p>
<p>But at the same time, how good are these yardsticks, really? They don’t seem strongly correlated with general-election success. Bill Clinton ranks fourth, seventh, third and sixth in them; Obama ranks fifth, second, fourth and first. How a candidate starts the general-election campaign simply isn’t as important as how he finishes it. So even if Biden starts the general election on the weaker side, there’s plenty of time for that to change, and history will ultimately judge him for one thing: whether he beats Trump in November.</p>
<p><b data-stringify-type="bold">CORRECTION (April 28, 2020, 10:55 a.m.):</b> A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that only Hillary Clinton ranked ahead of Joe Biden in the share of U.S. adults who had an opinion of recent Democratic nominees. Biden was behind both Clinton and Barack Obama.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are now about six months from the general election,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="13" href="#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;190 days, to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-13">13</sup></a> and while the national party conventions won’t make it official until August, President Trump will face former Vice President Joe Biden in November (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-if-a-presidential-nominee-can-no-longer-run-for-office/">barring something very unexpected happening</a>). So the question we’re left with now is: When should you start paying attention to the general election polls?</p>
<p>We at FiveThirtyEight have cautioned you not to take <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/">early general election polls</a> too seriously, but the answer for when you should tune in isn’t exactly straightforward either. There’s actually a pretty big debate over just how meaningful early general election polls are. MIT researcher Alexander Agadjanian and The Economist data journalist G. Elliott Morris <a href="https://www.thecrosstab.com/2017/01/03/history-polling-error-us-uk/">argue that early polls</a> in recent cycles have been closer to the final outcome than polls from previous cycles and should therefore be taken seriously. But political scientists Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Timeline-Presidential-Elections-Campaigns-American/dp/0226922154">maintain that while early general election polls</a> might be more accurate now, they’re still not as accurate as those conducted closer to Election Day, and that distinction matters as even small shifts in the polls can matter a great deal to the final outcome <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-blowout-presidential-elections-a-thing-of-the-past/">in our era of highly competitive elections</a>.</p>
<p>So to better understand <i>just</i> how meaningful early general election polling is we did our own analysis, collecting all the national surveys we could find from 1980 to 2016, spanning from 200 days before the presidential election to the day before. We then created a rolling, seven-day polling average of the margin between the Democratic and Republican nominees<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="14" href="#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we used the end date of a survey in our averages. If a pollster had more than one poll in a seven-day period, we included only the most recent survey. We also used the most inclusive polls possible, provided all candidates listed ran in the general election.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-14">14</sup></a> as that allowed us to calculate just how far off the polls were from the final Election Day vote share margin on any given day.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="15" href="#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;That is, we calculated the difference between the margin in the polling average and the final Election Day vote share margin, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/&quot;&gt;the sampling error inherent to all polling&lt;/a&gt;, though that is something else to keep in mind when looking at poll movement.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-15">15</sup></a> And what we found is, well … each side in this debate has a point. A satisfying answer, we know.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the margin in early general elections polls has been closer to the final national popular vote margin in recent cycles since at least 2004 &#8212; you can see this quite clearly in the chart below.</p>
<figure id="attachment_271122" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-271122" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/skelley.GENERAL-ELECTION-POLLS-1.0428.png" alt="" width="575" height="761" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/skelley.GENERAL-ELECTION-POLLS-1.0428.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/skelley.GENERAL-ELECTION-POLLS-1.0428.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>There just isn’t as much movement in the polling margin in recent elections. But even when early polls have been closer to the final outcome, the error has still often been large enough to swing an election from one party to the other. What’s more, the direction of the polling error has been inconsistent &#8212; sometimes polls tend to be Republican-leaning; at other times, Democratic-leaning. This error is substantial enough that it makes it hard to predict the final election result, even if the early polls aren’t <i>that</i> far off.</p>
<p>Take the last three presidential elections. In 2016, the polls about six months from the general election were about 2 points more Democratic than the final national popular vote margin (2.1 points), on average, so while they weren’t far off, the size of the error was about the same as the final margin in what was a very close race. But in 2008 and 2012, the early polls missed in a Republican direction: In 2008, Barack Obama won by 7.3 points, but then the average six months out was about 6 points more Republican than the final outcome. Similarly, in 2012, Obama won by 3.9 points, but the early polls were, on average, 2 points more Republican compared to the final margin.</p>
<p>The difference at the margins, in other words, can still be very meaningful. Consider the 2016 election. Trump lost the popular vote by 2 points but still won the presidency because our elections are determined by the Electoral College, <i>not</i> the national popular vote. It’s harder to imagine this being the case, though, had Trump lost the popular vote by 4 points, which was Clinton’s average lead between 150 and 200 days out.</p>
<p>Why did Clinton’s edge change from 4 points in the early surveys to 2 points in the final result? Well, for a variety of reasons. Polls are snapshots in time, while campaigns are dynamic events. And although some moments are somewhat predictable in their impact &#8212; such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/18/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-political-conventions-affect-the-horserace/">the convention bounce</a> &#8212; many others aren’t. This seems particularly important right now because <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-reelection-may-hinge-on-the-economy-and-coronavirus/">we don’t know how</a> the coronavirus pandemic will affect the standing of the two major-party nominees. And unexpected events can’t be discounted: Clinton <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/">may have lost</a> in 2016 in part because of the Comey Letter, which came out <i>less than two weeks</i> before the election.</p>
<p>All of this is to say it’s difficult to know how 2020 will shape up. Some pollsters <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/jan/03/more-year-after-2016-election-how-trustworthy-are-/">have adjusted their methodologies</a> after 2016 &#8212; such as <a href="https://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Reports/An-Evaluation-of-2016-Election-Polls-in-the-U-S.aspx">weighting samples by educational attainment</a> &#8212; and the 2020 race will happen under a different set of circumstances, so it’s not a given that polls will lean Democratic as they did four years ago. But what the polls can tell us right now is that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/upshot/polling-2020-biden-trump.html">2020 race should be pretty competitive</a>. As the campaign develops over the next few months, the electorate’s preferences could shift in small but meaningful ways that could ultimately be consequential. So look at the early polls &#8212; you know you’re going to anyway &#8212; but know that they are subject to change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with most aspects of our daily lives, the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the administration of elections. Several states have already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-coronavirus-means-the-2020-primary-season-will-end-later-than-ever/">postponed primaries</a> that were scheduled for this spring, and the few in-person elections that <i>have</i> taken place were <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voters-experiences-in-wisconsin-amid-the-coronavirus/">marred by chaos</a>. But with an election date of November 3 more or less <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/election-postponed-canceled.html">set in stone</a>, how can the general election be conducted safely if the pandemic is still raging in the fall?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/two-thirds-voters-back-vote-mail-november-2020-n1187976">Many officials and voters alike</a> think the solution is to conduct the election predominantly by mail — but that’s easier said than done. Converting to a vote-by-mail system is arduous and expensive, and most states simply aren’t set up to smoothly conduct a mail election with their present resources and laws.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx">state laws on the use of mail voting</a> are a patchwork quilt. Only five states regularly conduct mail elections by default: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Three more, though, do allow counties to opt into mail voting, and nine more allow certain elections to be conducted by mail — although these are typically low-turnout, local elections, a far cry from the 2020 presidential race.</p>
<p>Another 29 states (plus Washington, D.C.) give voters the option to vote by mail — also known as no-excuse absentee voting — in federal elections, but the burden is on the voter to request her ballot. The remaining 16 states still require voters to provide a valid excuse if they want to vote by mail, although this year, some states may accept concerns around the coronavirus as an excuse. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-hampshire-gov-sununu-to-allow-absentee-voting-in-november-because-of-coronavirus-outbreak/2020/04/09/d0aa21c8-7aa2-11ea-a130-df573469f094_story.html">New Hampshire</a> has already moved to do that for the general election.)</p>

<p>Additionally, several states may consider expanding the use of mail voting in November, at least if the coronavirus is still a threat. The secretaries of state of <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/03/18/arizona-secretary-state-wants-all-mail-elections-august-november-katie-hobbs/2869153001/">Arizona</a> and <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2020/04/minnesota-secretary-of-state-steve-simon-wants-to-let-minnesotans-vote-by-mail-gop-lawmakers-are-having-none-of-it/">Minnesota</a> want to mail ballots to all registered voters in the fall, and bills to that effect have been proposed in <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-illinois-voting-by-mail-20200410-egfdzrnm2ncc3e32ieknf7rnn4-story.html">Illinois</a> and <a href="https://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-prompts-massachusetts-lawmakers-to-file-vote-by-mail-bill.html">Massachusetts</a> as well. But don’t hold your breath: There are some major obstacles standing in the way of states expanding mail voting.</p>
<h2>What it would take to expand mail voting</h2>
<p>To start, there’s the fact that mail voting has evolved into a partisan issue. Republicans, led by President Trump, are strongly opposing efforts to convert to mail voting, arguing it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/republicans-vote-by-mail.html">boosts Democratic turnout</a> or enables voter fraud. In reality, <a href="http://www.andrewbenjaminhall.com/Thompson_et_al_VBM.pdf">most studies</a> have shown that mail voting does not advantage either party, and voter fraud is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html">extremely rare</a>, both in person and by mail. Indeed, Republican legislators have already spoken out against the proposals in Arizona and Minnesota, and President Trump and other Republicans have said <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-covid-19-blame-game-is-going-to-get-uglier/">they will oppose</a> national efforts to encourage election reform.</p>
<p>But the bigger hurdle may be logistical. States can’t just snap their fingers and pull off a mail election on a dime; election administrators with whom we spoke agreed that preparing for a mail election is a challenge.</p>
<p><a href=""><img alt="Should we sacrifice our data privacy to fight the coronavirus?" class="abc-poster-video" width="640" height="360" src="https://s.abcnews.com/images/fivethirtyeight/200424_538_coronavirus_data_privacy1_hpMain_16x9_1600.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>First, ballots need to be printed in massive quantities weeks in advance of the election. The Brennan Center for Justice, an advocacy group that supports expanded mail voting as <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/how-protect-2020-vote-coronavirus">one way to insulate elections from the effects of the pandemic</a>, recommends printing 1.2 times as many ballots as there are registered voters to account for the possibility of more people registering to vote closer to the election. That’s a tall order for any state, but especially ones that normally use electronic voting machines and aren’t used to handling large volumes of paper ballots. And then, of course, for every ballot, you need a corresponding envelope to mail it in — and, as elections administration expert Tammy Patrick <a href="https://theappeal.org/politicalreport/how-states-can-shore-up-mail-voting/">told The Appeal</a> last month, “it’s not like these are just regular old envelopes that you can go down to Home Depot and buy.” They must include instructions for the voter — which have to be thoughtfully designed to guide confused voters — and are often custom-ordered.</p>
<p>There’s also the burden of assisting voters with the transition. Since Hawaii <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/beat/ige-signs-all-mail-voting-automatic-recount-bills/">enacted default mail voting last year</a>, Rex Quidilla, the elections administrator for the City and County of Honolulu, said his office has had to significantly ramp up support services for voters, such as providing replacements for ballots that get lost in the mail. In addition, his office has invested more time in maintaining the voter rolls to ensure that each voter’s address is up to date — otherwise, she won’t get her ballot. And Myrna Pérez, the director of the Brennan Center&#8217;s Voting Rights and Elections Program, recommended that officials hire public education specialists to assist with voter education. “People need to know that the election system is going to look a little different for them and what their options are,” she said. “[Election officials] should start working with local post offices to make sure that people know what to do with mail ballots, make sure they have tracking systems,” and other precautions to ensure no valid voter is disenfranchised.</p>
<p>Doing all that, while also stuffing and mailing out millions of ballot envelopes, is a herculean task — perhaps an impossible one for many election offices at current staffing levels. Earlier this month, Wisconsin election officials reported <a href="https://twitter.com/srl/status/1245750010442125314">being overwhelmed</a> by absentee-ballot requests and simply being <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/03/31/coronavirus-wisconsin-tony-evers-asks-state-workers-staff-polls/5093547002/">physically unable to fulfill them all</a>, which led to many voters <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/voters-reporting-delays-in-receiving-absentee-ballots/article_81c60d8b-0170-5b03-b7c7-13f5e90a74dc.html">never receiving their ballots</a>. So mail voting also requires more staff. For example, Quidilla had to establish multiple new positions to coordinate all the new services Honolulu is providing to voters. Hiring and training new workers is a big lift under normal circumstances — but election offices in 2020 have the added challenge of doing it during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Then, when the ballots are returned, they need to be counted. For some jurisdictions, this means even more bodies: Armstead B.C. Jones Sr., director of the Baltimore City Board of Elections, said he has already enlisted some election judges to help canvass mail ballots for the two mail elections he is conducting this spring — a special election for Maryland’s 7th Congressional District on April 28 and the Maryland primary election on June 2. For others, it means investing in specialized equipment like high-speed ballot scanners, automated mail sorting systems and signature-matching software. Honolulu is one jurisdiction that has embraced automation. “We were already at a point where manually processing the returned ballots was just not feasible anymore,” Quidilla said. “We’re a jurisdiction of half a million registered voters; it would be very difficult for us to receive and verify all these [ballots] on a manual basis.”</p>
<p>And, of course, all this — from printing ballots, to ordering envelopes, to hiring and training new workers, to buying new equipment — costs money. That alone could thwart some states from switching to mail voting this year, such as Florida, where county officials say they <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/os-ne-coronavirus-vote-by-mail-florida-20200408-pstr7vjipzf6dduvelouud4kxy-story.html">just don’t have the cash</a> to purchase necessary vote-counting machines at $1 million a pop. In March, the Brennan Center estimated that it would <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures">cost between $982 million and $1.4 billion</a> to implement mail voting nationwide, with the biggest single expense being, simply, postage.</p>
<p>That said, a mail election <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/03/coloradovotingreformsearlyresults.pdf">isn’t necessarily more expensive</a> than a traditional one, since mail elections save money in other areas. Jones told FiveThirtyEight that, while Baltimore did incur additional expenses by paying for postage on “both ends — going out and coming back,” he expects to spend less on election judges because they won’t be needed to staff polling places on election day. “There’s a give and take on savings and expenses,” he noted. “We’ll find out toward the end [whether the mail election was more or less expensive than usual].”</p>
<h2>The outlook for mail voting</h2>
<p>Given these challenges, you might think expanded mail voting has little chance of being adopted, let alone implemented, in any new states by November. While that skepticism is probably warranted, the pandemic is a powerful motivator, and universal mail voting is definitely closer to reality in some states than in others. Most importantly, <a href="https://theappeal.org/politicalreport/how-states-can-shore-up-mail-voting/">experts say</a> that states with at least some level of mail-voting infrastructure in place could more easily make the transition to vote-by-mail.</p>
<p>To better understand which states are most prepared to conduct the 2020 election by mail, we looked at the party control of a state (since vote-by-mail probably has the best chance of passing in Democratic-controlled states), in addition to how many of its registered voters were sent absentee/mail ballots in the last two federal general elections. By looking at both the percentage who received a ballot and the raw number who <i>didn’t</i> receive a ballot (a useful proxy for the number of additional ballots a state would have to mail in order to achieve full vote-by-mail status), we can get a sense of just how close certain states are to a world in which every registered voter is sent a ballot.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="16" href="#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;This analysis is based on numbers self-reported by the states to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission&rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/2016_EAVS_Comprehensive_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/2018_EAVS_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt; Election Administration and Voting Surveys, but it&rsquo;s worth noting these numbers may not always represent mail voting in the strictest sense. For instance, Iowa and New York included in-person absentee votes in their 2018 mail-voting numbers because they do not track the two methods separately, and data from state election offices in Indiana, Maine and Minnesota (as well as New Mexico, for 2018 only) also differs from what was reported to the EAC, suggesting that the EAC numbers include in-person absentee votes in those states as well. (A spokesman for the Indiana secretary of state said he was not sure of the reason for the discrepancy but stood by his office&rsquo;s data; the other states did not respond to our requests for clarification.) While in-person absentee voting does share many characteristics with mail voting, there are also key differences (e.g., no need for postage), so be careful about drawing conclusions about how close these states are to universal mail voting.&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="notes">It’s not possible to calculate these numbers for North Dakota, as it doesn’t have voter registration. However, it does have a relatively high rate of mail voting — 23 percent of its votes were cast by mail in 2016, and 29 percent in 2018. Republicans control both the governorship and state legislature in North Dakota.</p>
<p class="notes">When asked how Oregon mailed ballots to 104 percent of voters in 2018, state election officials responded that the EAC number was “off” but did not provide further details.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for proponents of mail voting, there’s no state that does well on all three criteria that doesn’t already default to vote-by-mail. (Note how longtime vote-by-mail states like Oregon and Washington sent ballots to virtually every registered voter.) But there are some states where the hurdles may not be insurmountable. Based on the existing prevalence of absentee voting, Montana (where 63 percent of voters were sent ballots in 2018, and only about 260,000 were not) and Arizona (62 percent, 1.60 million) look like the easiest places to implement vote-by-mail; however, their Republican legislatures may lack the appetite to pass it. As we mentioned earlier, Arizona Republicans seem cool on the Democratic secretary of state’s proposal to make the switch. Montana, though, does have a Democratic governor who already steered the state’s June primary to a <a href="https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/montanas-primary-election-moves-to-mail-ballot/article_cfb42771-38b1-5f21-aba4-c2526a644dd9.html">default mail election</a>. And California isn’t that far behind either, having sent ballots to 54 percent of its registered voters in 2018. In addition, it’s completely run by Democrats, but its sheer size means around 11.48 million more people would need to be sent ballots before the Golden State automatically gives everyone the option to vote by mail — a daunting lift.</p>
<p>Far more states are starting from a position of negligible mail-voting infrastructure, however. A full 29 states (plus D.C.) sent ballots to fewer than 10 percent of their registered voters in 2018. Even many blue states that might be the most eager to switch to mail voting might find it challenging, such as New York, where only 3 percent of voters were given an absentee ballot in 2018, and about 12.35 million were not.</p>
<p>As for the states that could <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/sites/default/files/2020-03/EC%20030920.4.pdf">decide the presidential election</a>, Arizona seems best prepared to switch to mail voting. A respectable proportion of Florida (25 percent in both 2016 and 2018) already votes by mail, but, as mentioned earlier, a lack of resources will probably prevent the Sunshine State from getting mail ballots in the hands of its remaining 10-11 million registrants. Michigan (where 15 percent of voters were sent a ballot in 2018, but 6.35 million were not) is in a similar boat, although a 2018 ballot initiative to liberalize the state’s voting laws could help grease the skids. Finally, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and (as we’ve already seen) Wisconsin have historically not had a significant culture of mail voting and would likely have a rough transition to a vote-by-mail system, should the need arise.</p>
<p>Any state considering conducting November’s election by mail should start laying the groundwork as soon as possible for the best chance of success. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s <a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/electionofficials/vbm/VBMProjectTimeline.pdf">recommended timeline</a> to expand the use of vote-by-mail starts in the first week of April — which was, of course, four weeks ago. “States should start working on it now,” Pérez urged. “The election is too important to not start troubleshooting now.” Jones, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/maryland-postpones-april-28-primary-election-over-coronavirus-133776">learned in mid-March</a> that he would have to conduct a mail election on April 28, concurred: “We could’ve definitely used more time.” According to Jones, Maryland did not start mailing ballots for the election until two and a half weeks before the election. “That could’ve been more timely, to give people ample time to work on them and get them back in. I’m still getting some emails that people haven’t received ballots.” But despite that, Jones thinks the benefits of vote-by-mail outweigh the challenges. “I just believe that mail-out ballots are probably the right way to go. We just need to tighten up the process and get it fine-tuned. I think it’s the way of the future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Primary season began back on Feb. 3 in Iowa with a competitive, multicandidate race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and some reasonable chance that the process would end with <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-15-percent-threshold-for-primary-delegates-could-winnow-the-field/">tense delegate counting</a> at the national convention in Milwaukee. However, after a string of primary losses in March and April, Sen. Bernie Sanders <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bernie-sanders-lost/">suspended his campaign</a> and former Vice President Joe Biden is now the presumptive Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that delegate counting is over. There are still 24 delayed and reconfigured contests with a combined 1,555 delegates at stake. Sure, Biden has already amassed 1,293 delegates<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="17" href="#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Per the ABC News delegate tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-17">17</sup></a> and is very likely to exceed the 1,991 pledged delegates necessary to clinch the nomination. But just how many delegates Sanders can rack up matters, because that will impact the concessions he and his campaign can win from Biden and the Democratic National Committee.</p>
<p>Any leverage Sanders has in that back and forth with Biden and the DNC hinges on three main factors. And two could work against the Vermont senator in any talks with the Biden team.</p>
<p>First, Sanders stands to lose a significant number of delegates headed into the convention. According to the DNC’s <a href="https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2020-Delegate-Selection-Rules-12.17.18-FINAL.pdf#page=14">2020 delegate selection rules</a>, any candidate who is no longer running loses the statewide delegates<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="18" href="#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Remember, there are delegates allocated at both the state and the district level. And those that are allocated based on statewide results &amp;#8212; at-large and PLEO delegates &amp;#8212; are reallocated when a candidate drops out. Delegates won at the congressional district level are not reallocated.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-18">18</sup></a> they have won and those delegates are then reallocated to candidates still in the race. (That has not necessarily been how the DNC has interpreted <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/06/suspending-vs-withdrawing.html">this rule previously</a>, but it is how the DNC has signaled that it will <a href="https://www.coloradodems.org/2020-presidential-primary-results/">use it in 2020</a>.) Second, if Sanders fails to clear the 25 percent delegate threshold required to secure representatives on convention committees, it’ll be harder to integrate his policies into the official DNC platform.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sanders-shouldnt-expect-a-big-delegate-boost-from-candidates-who-dropped-out/">written previously for FiveThirtyEight</a> about delegate reallocation and what that looked like after the race became a one-on-one contest between Biden and Sanders (a bit of a wash, with Biden picking up 23 statewide delegates and Sanders 25 from the early and Super Tuesday states). But now that Sanders has suspended his campaign, the delegates he won prior to dropping out will be reallocated, meaning he could lose more than a third of his <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-primaries-caucuses-calendar-page/story?id=68485300">delegates</a> &#8212; 365 statewide delegates in total.</p>

<p class="notes">Sanders’s statewide delegate total includes those delegates originally allocated to him plus those reallocated to him after other candidates dropped out.</p>
<p class="notes">Three contests were excluded: American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands and Wyoming. In American Samoa, Sanders did not win any delegates. In the Northern Mariana Islands, delegates cannot be reallocated, so the four Sanders delegates will go to the convention uncommitted. And in Wyoming, there are no rules for how the reallocation process would work.</p>
</footer>
</section>
<p>That matters because without those statewide delegates, it would be nearly impossible for Sanders to clear the 25 percent delegate threshold needed to secure a spot on convention committees.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="19" href="#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt; To be clear, this isn&rsquo;t a hard and fast rule. The Sanders delegation would still have a voice at the convention, for instance, if they didn&rsquo;t clear the 25 percent delegate threshold, but their formal channels for engaging with the party would be limited. For example, they wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be able to submit a minority report to the full convention expressing their dissent with party platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-19">19</sup></a></p>
<p>Why does a seat at the table on these committees matter? Well, the answer circles back to the concessions that Sanders, his campaign and his supporters would like to extract from the DNC and Biden. Making up 25 percent or more of the delegates on the various convention committees means that the Sanders contingent at the convention would have a seat at the table.</p>
<p>Sanders still doesn’t have 20 percent of all pledged delegates, but 25 percent is within his reach should he continue to clear the 15 percent threshold to qualify for delegates in the remaining contests. And if Alaska is any indication, then Sanders will be in decent shape to get there. Biden took eight delegates in the Last Frontier to Sanders’s seven. But that effort takes a hit if the Vermont senator loses more than a third of the delegates he has won to date. That would leave Sanders with just 12 percent of pledged delegates.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, though: The delegate math may not actually matter all that much. The Biden campaign seems keen to avoid the mistakes of 2016. They have already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/politics/biden-sanders-medicare-student-debt.html">moved toward Sanders’s position</a> on a number of issues, like expanding Medicare and student loan forgiveness programs, and have even <a href="https://apnews.com/fcba9e4dcd0732de71587c9b57ac1d53">floated letting Sanders keep his statewide delegates</a>, rather than have them reallocated to Biden.</p>
<p>Party unity — or at least the appearance of it — is at a premium for Democrats, and the Sanders campaign knows this. It’s this third factor that Sanders’s leverage hinges on, and arguably, it’s the one that could work best to his advantage.</p>
<p>It is still a delicate dance for Sanders, though, as the rules as they currently stand could cost him. Treated like the other candidates who won delegates but then withdrew, Sanders would lose a seat at the table, so the next move is Biden’s.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, but the 2020 primary season is only getting longer — because the public-health threat posed by the new coronavirus keeps delaying primary elections. A grand total of 17 presidential primaries have now been postponed on account of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Since our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/13-presidential-primaries-have-now-been-delayed-over-the-coronavirus/">last dispatch on this topic</a>, four more states have been added to the ranks: <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-pushes-back-its-primary-to-june-2.html">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-primary-election-delay-20200328-aibutrk6tbcz7o4azc3abvof5a-story.html">New York</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/007607e2219d8c11fd1b9e72a28e8183">West Virginia</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2020/04/08/murphy-officially-delays-new-jersey-primary-to-july-7-i-dont-want-a-wisconsin-1273863">New Jersey</a>. In addition, five places that had already postponed their primaries rescheduled <i>a second time</i>: <a href="https://apnews.com/77e1c1806b756e201ea22efe1af18583">Ohio</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/490890-puerto-rico-delays-its-primary-a-second-time">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-primary-delayed-again-june-during-coronavirus-emergency/W5ElsYWTsP5clpNAVTYXnO/">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/coronavirus/article_9dcb7ac4-7e6f-11ea-9692-2fec64255ede.html">Louisiana</a> and <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2020/04/17/lamont-postpones-presidential-primary-until-aug-11/">Connecticut</a>. All these moves have left us with a presidential primary calendar that is extremely backloaded.</p>
<figure id="attachment_271063" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-271063" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rakich-ELECTION-DELAY-UPDATE.png" alt="" width="575" height="670" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rakich-ELECTION-DELAY-UPDATE.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rakich-ELECTION-DELAY-UPDATE.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>Since March 17 — the last big competitive primary day and the first that really ran up against the coronavirus scare — only three states have wrapped up their presidential primaries. By contrast, nine contests are now slated for June 2, which has become a sort of unexpected mini Super Tuesday. And five primaries are now taking place after June 9, which was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-could-all-those-primary-postponements-change-the-delegate-math/">originally the last day</a> for states to hold their primaries without penalty.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Democratic National Committee decides to go easy on them, but some of these primaries are <i>really</i> late. Connecticut’s, for example, is now scheduled for Aug. 11, which is just a week before the Democratic National Convention (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/politics/dnc-postponed-coronavirus/index.html">which was itself rescheduled</a>). And according to presidential primaries expert and FiveThirtyEight contributor Josh Putnam, that would be the latest contest ever in the modern era of presidential primaries.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it’s fair to wonder whether these elections even need to still happen. Sen. Bernie Sanders has suspended his campaign, and Biden is for all intents and purposes the Democratic nominee. But one reason the primaries are still needed is <a href="https://twitter.com/FHQ/status/1246095338735312898?s=20">delegates</a> — Biden technically isn’t the nominee until a majority of delegates vote to make him one at the Democratic convention, and primaries decide who those delegates will be. That said, some states, such as <a href="https://www.courant.com/politics/capitol-watch/hc-pol-connecticut-primary-moved-august-11-20200417-a2qaz6oc7jahnf67pb2yxse5fq-story.html">Connecticut</a> and <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/campaigns-elections/new-york-presidential-primary-likely-canceled.html">New York</a>, do allow presidential primaries to be canceled if there is only one candidate on the ballot. According to Putnam, if everyone <i>except</i> Biden withdraws from those primaries, he would simply get all their delegates. However, the actual elections would still have to go on because …</p>
<p>Another reason is that the presidential race isn’t the only thing on many states’ primary ballots. Indeed, the coronavirus has also forced 15 states to postpone their <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/1/14/1855760/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2020-primary-calendar?link_id=19&amp;can_id=5f27a3767bd4756f5c4ec89f31b71bbe&amp;source=email-morning-digest-facing-ethics-probe-gop-congressman-in-competitive-seat-spends-big-on-legal-fees&amp;email_referrer=email_780555&amp;email_subject=morning-digest-facing-ethics-probe-gop-congressman-in-competitive-seat-spends-big-on-legal-fees">down-ballot primary or runoff elections</a> as well, many of which were happening the same day as the presidential primary. The most recent states to do so are <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/virginia-politics/northam-delays-june-primaries-asks-general-assembly-to-reschedule-may-elections">Virginia</a>, <a href="https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/politics/governor-mills-issues-executive-order-moving-primary-election-to-july-14-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19-concerns/97-5dc8f2dc-c527-4744-91a4-479e5fd0284b">Maine</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DKElections/status/1252666015982522368?s=20">Idaho</a>, plus four states that hold their presidential and down-ballot primaries concurrently (Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia).</p>
<p>As for the primaries that are still happening in the next several weeks, most are taking a different form. In general, states are moving away from in-person voting and embracing mail voting, but the coronavirus has revealed just how many versions of a “predominantly mail election” there can be. For example, the <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/elections/bs-md-pol-primary-hogan-decision-20200410-rvphpqz4mjfqdpnfrhjrifyqxm-story.html">Maryland</a> and <a href="https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/montanas-primary-election-moves-to-mail-ballot/article_cfb42771-38b1-5f21-aba4-c2526a644dd9.html">Montana</a> primaries on June 2 have switched to vote-by-mail elections in the “traditional” sense — i.e., all registered voters will be mailed a ballot, but in-person voting options will still be available for those who need them. Reportedly, <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2020/04/20/new-york-voting-by-mail-to-be-allowed-for-june-elections-queens-borough-president-congress">New York</a> plans to do the same, but so far the only change made to its June 23 primary is that voters can use the coronavirus as an excuse to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-yorkers-can-vote-by-absentee-ballot-because-of-coronavirus-11586385420">request an absentee ballot</a>. Meanwhile, in <a href="https://twitter.com/KansasDems/status/1244657591478816769">Kansas’s presidential primary</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/26002ad8b3a1eef41deef71e00c69ae7">Utah’s down-ballot primary</a>, voters were already being mailed a ballot by default, but normal polling places will now be closed.</p>
<p>At least 11 other jurisdictions are stopping short of mailing voters a ballot, but <i>are</i> mailing them an absentee-ballot <i>application</i>. Of these, <a href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/election/article241633846.html">Idaho</a> is not offering any in-person voting options, and <a href="https://www.thedickinsonpress.com/opinion/columns/5021978-Mike-Jacobs-Primary-could-test-new-way-of-voting-in-North-Dakota">many</a> <a href="https://www.wahpetondailynews.com/news/applications-coming-in-mail-for-nd-primary-voting/article_e312c8b2-834c-11ea-9109-d79dd34cab25.html">counties</a> in <a href="https://www.kvrr.com/2020/04/21/north-dakota-residents-to-receive-applications-for-absentee-ballots/">North Dakota</a> are closing in-person voting sites as well.

<p>Perhaps the most novel setup is in <a href="https://apnews.com/77e1c1806b756e201ea22efe1af18583">Ohio</a>, the very next primary on the calendar (voting there ends on Tuesday). The election will be conducted almost entirely by mail, but the state isn’t doing much to assist voters &#8212; all they will receive is a postcard with instructions on how to request an absentee ballot. Nor will most voters have the option to vote in person; only voters with disabilities or without mailing addresses will be allowed at a voting center on April 28. No other state has done so little to help voters get their hands on a ballot, so it will be interesting to see what turnout is like in Ohio compared with other states conducting elections under the same conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>
<h2><b>Poll(s) of the week</b></h2>
<p>The coronavirus continues to affect daily life, keeping many Americans at home and away from work, restaurants and other businesses. Naturally, pollsters are very focused on how Americans <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-most-republicans-agree-with-people-protesting-stay-at-home-orders/">are responding to all of this</a>, so here’s a look at the latest surveys.</p>
<p>First, in perhaps troubling news for President Trump, since last week there’s been a slight uptick in the number of Americans who disapprove of how he’s handling the crisis, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/">FiveThirtyEight’s tracker of coronavirus polling</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_271067" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/?ex_cid=rrpromo"><img class="size-full wp-image-271067" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-5.39.21-PM.png" alt="" width="575" height="402" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-5.39.21-PM.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-5.39.21-PM.png?w=1150 2x" /></a></figure>
		
<p>In one of the recent polls asking how Trump is managing the crisis, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/yahoo-news-you-gov-coronavirus-poll-most-americans-reject-antilockdown-protests-124259347.html">Yahoo News/YouGov found</a> that 49 percent disapproved of his response while 45 percent approved. But it also found that 65 percent of Americans thought Trump could have reduced the virus’s impact “a lot” or “somewhat” had he acted sooner. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200451_crosstabs_CORONAVIRUS_CONTENT_RVs_v2_JB-1.pdf">Morning Consult’s latest survey</a> also gave Trump mixed reviews &#8212; 48 percent approved and 46 percent disapproved of how he’s handling the pandemic. The poll also found that just 7 percent of Americans felt the federal government was doing “too much” in response to the coronavirus, while 45 percent said it wasn’t doing enough and 40 percent said it was doing “the right amount.” And finally, a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-prioritize-staying-home-and-worry-restrictions-will-lift-too-fast-cbs-news-poll/">CBS News poll also found</a> Trump’s ratings slightly underwater, with 52 percent saying he was doing a bad job handling the outbreak versus 48 percent who said he was doing a good job. Additionally, 57 percent said the country’s dealings with the health crisis were “going badly.”</p>
<p>Five new polls in four battleground states also gave Trump mediocre marks for his handling of COVID-19. In Florida, <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/florida/release-detail?ReleaseID=3659">Quinnipiac University</a> showed that 51 percent disapproved of his response compared with 46 percent who approved, and a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-april-18-21-2020-pennsylvania">Pennsylvania survey by Fox News found</a> similar numbers, 51 percent disapproved and 44 percent approved. Two Michigan polls gave Trump almost identical marks there, too: <a href="https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Michigan-April-2020-Covid-19-Survey-Report-Final.pdf">Glengariff Group</a> found 50 percent disapproved and 44 percent approved while <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-april-18-21-2020-michigan">Fox News found</a> 50 percent disapproved and 45 percent approved. And in Arizona, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ryz130ujgzjcu6j/Arizona%20Public%20Opinion%20Pulse%20-%20Coronavirus.pdf?dl=0">OH Predictive Insights found</a> that 50 percent disapproved of his handling of the crisis while 46 percent approved.</p>
<p>On the other hand, state and local governments have received high marks for their decision-making regarding the coronavirus. Morning Consult’s poll found that 73 percent of Americans approved of how their state governments are handling the crisis compared to just 21 percent who disapproved, and 75 percent approved of their local government’s response. And <a href="https://www.civisanalytics.com/blog/healthcare/coronavirus-pulse-survey-research/">Civis found</a> that 80 percent or more supported policies enacted by state governments to slow the spread of the coronavirus, like orders to shelter in place and restrictions on dining in restaurants.</p>
<p>But there’s real concern about a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. The Yahoo News/YouGov survey found that 71 percent of Americans are more concerned about lifting restrictions too quickly than too slowly, and an identical share said they want public officials to be capable of mass testing before lifting restrictions on normal activities. Similarly, 63 percent told CBS News they are more worried about reopening too fast and causing the outbreak to worsen than reopening too slowly and hurting the economy. Those results align with other surveys that found Americans are largely content with staying at home to limit the outbreak: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/despite-scattered-protests-most-americans-support-shelter-in-place-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN22336P">Reuters/Ipsos found</a> that 72 percent said people should stay at home until health officials say it’s safe, while an <a href="https://apnews.com/9ed271ca13012d3b77a2b631c1979ce1">AP-NORC survey suggested</a> that most are fine with the restrictions in their area &#8212; 61 percent said they were about right and 26 percent said they didn’t go far enough. The country also seems ready for such policies to remain in effect for a while longer, as <a href="https://elucd.com/covid19/usa-coronavirus-preparedness">Elucd’s tracker found</a> that 65 percent expect disruptions to last at least two more months.</p>
<p>However, one major concern with the stay-at-home orders and business closures continues to be the huge economic fallout from the coronavirus, especially now that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-states-with-lockdown-protests-been-hit-harder-by-unemployment/">more than 26 million Americans have lost their jobs</a>. Overall, 87 percent of Americans are very or somewhat worried about the coronavirus’s effect on the economy, according to our tracker, which is largely unchanged from last week.</p>
<figure id="attachment_271069" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-271069" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-5.40.04-PM.png" alt="" width="575" height="393" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-5.40.04-PM.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-5.40.04-PM.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>In a <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/04/21/about-half-of-lower-income-americans-report-household-job-or-wage-loss-due-to-covid-19/">Pew Research Center</a> survey, 43 percent of Americans said that they or someone in their household had lost a job or taken a pay cut because of the pandemic. The survey found lower-income adults were particularly hard hit: Only 23 percent said they had enough money to cover their expenses for three months if they lost their job or became sick. Forty-eight percent of middle-income earners and 75 percent of high-income individuals said the same. There was also a racial disparity: 53 percent of white respondents said they had enough to last three months compared to 27 percent of black respondents and 29 percent of Latino respondents. And as a <a href="https://money.com/stimulus-check-coronavirus-money-survey/">Money/Morning Consult survey found</a>, the federal government’s stimulus checks may be insufficient for many Americans — 74 percent said either they had already spent the money or it would only last them four weeks or less.</p>
<p>Americans remain more anxious about the economy than their health, but large numbers also continue to worry about personally catching the virus or someone close to them getting infected. About 7 in 10 Americans are somewhat or very worried about this, according to our tracker, which is a slight decrease from about 10 days ago, when 3 in 4 Americans said the same.</p>

<h2><b>Other polling bites</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">With the coronavirus threat hanging over the November general election, an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/two-thirds-voters-back-vote-mail-november-2020-n1187976">NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey</a> found that 58 percent of Americans were in favor of changing election laws to allow all voters to cast ballots by mail, while another 9 percent opposed a permanent change but said they backed voting by mail if it was allowed just for this November’s election. Twenty-nine percent opposed changing laws to allow everyone to vote by mail under any circumstance. There was an ample partisan gap, as 88 percent of Democrats backed some version of expanding vote-by-mail in 2020, compared to just 44 percent of Republicans (69 percent of independents also supported increased access).</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Forty-one percent of Democrats<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="20" href="#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Including independents who lean Democratic.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-20">20</sup></a> said in a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/20/some-democrats-are-bothered-nominee-is-an-older-white-man-and-they-solidly-back-biden-in-november/">Pew Research Center survey</a> that they were bothered by the fact that a white man in his 70s will be their presidential nominee, while 59 percent said it didn’t bother them. The survey found no difference in how men and women responded, but it did find a difference in responses across race, as 49 percent of white Democrats said they were bothered by this, compared with 30 percent and 28 percent of Latino and black Democrats, respectively. That may come as a surprise, given the <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/">diversity of the Democratic base</a>, but perhaps it’s not totally unexpected, given <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-democrats-have-shifted-left-over-the-last-30-years/">how far to the left white liberals have moved</a> on issues of race and discrimination in recent years.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/21/endorsements-biden-younger-voters/">new survey from Morning Consult</a> found that former Vice President Joe Biden’s favorability among Democratic primary voters went up after he received endorsements from former President Barack Obama and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren &#8212; two former primary foes. His overall favorability among Democratic primary voters ticked up to 78 percent for the week ending on April 19, 2 points higher than it was the week before. Notably, his favorability shot up among younger Democrats, including a 5-point increase among 18-to-29 year olds and a 3-point increase among 30-to-44 year olds.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">A number of governors <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-like-how-their-governor-is-handling-the-coronavirus-outbreak/">have gotten rave reviews</a> for managing their states during the ongoing crisis, but New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu may have topped them all. A <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1581&amp;context=survey_center_polls">survey from the University of New Hampshire</a> found that 89 percent of New Hampshirites approve of how he’s handling the coronavirus situation.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Half of Americans said they found staying at home at least somewhat stressful, according to a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/poll-stay-at-home-coronavirus_n_5e9a269bc5b63639081e8a42">HuffPost/YouGov survey</a> that looked at how people are coping with remaining indoors. But 67 percent of people who described themselves as generally “anxious” said they were stressed out, compared to just 39 percent of people who said they were by nature more “calm.”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">With so many people trying to social distance, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/309203/increased-low-contact-services-may-prove-permanent.aspx">Gallup found</a> that there’s been a rise in the use of services, like food delivery, curbside pickup and virtual doctor visits. For example, 14 percent of respondents said they’d used a grocery delivery service more often during the coronavirus situation than they used to compared to 8 percent who said so in late March, and 28 percent said they’d used curbside pickup more often versus just 16 percent late last month.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Trump approval</b></h2>

<p>According to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/">presidential approval tracker</a>, 43.4 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.6 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -9.2 points). At this time <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-are-americans-adjusting-to-life-in-a-pandemic/">last week</a>, 44.2 percent approved and 51.7 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -7.5 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 43.7 percent and a disapproval rating of 51.6 percent, for a net approval rating of -7.9 points.</p>

<p>In our average of polls of the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/">generic congressional ballot</a>, Democrats currently lead by 7.6 percentage points (48.1 percent to 40.5 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 7.8 points (48.6 percent to 40.8 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 7.4 points (48.8 percent to 41.4 percent).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I wrote about how New York has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-coronavirus-curve/">successfully bent the coronavirus curve</a> after an extended period of social distancing. The evidence this week is even stronger. As of Wednesday, just <a href="https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Map?%3Aembed=yes&amp;%3Atoolbar=no&amp;%3Atabs=n">27.6 percent of newly reported COVID-19 tests in New York City were positive</a>, still a fairly high rate &#8212; but substantially down from a peak of 59.4 percent on March 29. Other states are also seeing a decline in new cases &#8212; Louisiana, in particular, has seen a <a href="https://twitter.com/Crimealytics/status/1253028684623118336?s=20">highly encouraging turnaround.</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, New York and Louisiana aren’t the norm. In fact, there isn’t really any norm. While the situation in many states is improving, in <b><i>nearly half </i></b><b>of all states in the U.S., there are as many COVID-19 cases as ever, and in some cases, even more</b>.</p>

<p>As I’ve written before, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/">the number of new confirmed cases can be a deceptive indicator of how much the coronavirus is spreading</a> unless you also account for how many tests are conducted. But the stubborn persistence of the novel coronavirus in many parts of the country isn’t just an artifact of rising testing volume.</p>
<p>In fact, the <a href="https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking/status/1253071865024667648?s=20">number of tests has been at a plateau for several weeks in the U.S.</a> But that isn’t necessarily the case in individual states. So in this article, I’ll go through some additional calculations to estimate how the share of positive tests has changed in each state over the past several weeks. Before I go into more detail, though, you should know that the conclusions would largely be the same with whatever metric I chose. Newly diagnosed cases, the positive test rate and the number of deaths are all showing progress in <i>some</i> states &#8212; but getting <i>worse</i> in plenty of others. In other words, the United States has not yet turned the corner nationwide.</p>
<h2>How to estimate positive test rates</h2>
<p>All 50 states and the District of Columbia now make some effort to report both positive and negative test results. In theory, that should allow us to calculate the share of tests that are positive and how that has changed over time. Given that the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/experts-say-the-coronavirus-outlook-has-worsened-but-the-trajectory-is-still-unclear/">large majority of infections are probably undetected</a>, no measure is perfect. But our analysis of various testing scenarios suggests that the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/us-coronavirus-outbreak-out-control-test-positivity-rate/610132/">rate of positive tests</a> is usually a truer indicator of the actual, underlying spread of the disease than the raw number of positives.</p>
<p>However, while most states diligently update their data on the number of positive tests, the quality of reporting on negative tests varies. For instance, while New York publishes <a href="https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Map?%3Aembed=yes&amp;%3Atoolbar=no&amp;%3Atabs=n">detailed reports</a> on the number of positive and negative tests each day, California takes a more casual approach with reporting its negatives. On Wednesday, for example, California reported more than 160,000 “new” negative tests &#8212; as compared with just 7,000 negatives on Tuesday. It is highly unlikely that these new tests were <i>actually</i> conducted on Wednesday. Instead, California was <a href="https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking/status/1253073282435174400?s=20">likely clearing a backlog</a> of tests that had been conducted days &#8212; or even weeks &#8212; ago.</p>
<p>Having looked at a lot of this data, I know that California isn’t the only offender. So I developed some techniques to smooth erratic reporting on negative tests, which should allow us to come up with reasonable estimates even in states that don’t have great data. (Because this is a story about the coronavirus and not one on methods for handling dodgy data, feel free to skip to the next section if you don’t care about the nitty gritty.) In any event, I’ll be brief. It’s basically a three-step process:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">First, if a state has days where it skips reporting any testing at all &#8212; that is, it doesn’t report on the existence of any new positive <i>or</i> negative tests &#8212; I spread the data evenly over any skipped days once it does report new tests. For instance, if Alabama doesn’t report any data on Sunday, and then reports the existence of 100 new tests on Monday, I assign half of those tests to Sunday and keep half of them on Monday.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Second, because reporting on negative tests has become more comprehensive over time, I pick a date in each state when its reporting on negative tests first became “usable.” Usable is a low bar and the date varies wildly from state to state. A state’s reporting can still be erratic; that’s what the next step is designed to deal with. But to be usable, a state has to be making some effort at being comprehensive &#8212; for instance, by including data both from state-run laboratories and private labs among its negative tests counts. It’s challenging though to pinpoint when a state’s data is usable, and something that has to be done by hand.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="21" href="#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;I examined the data in each state, looking for abrupt jumps in the number of negatives reported, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200324022544/https://covidtracking.com/data/&quot;&gt;consulted archived notes at The COVID Tracking Project&lt;/a&gt; for what the state&rsquo;s reporting standards were at any given time. Some states have had usable data going all the way back to early March; for others, it has only happened in the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-21">21</sup></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Third, within the window where a state’s negative test data is usable, I apply a <a href="https://www.stata.com/manuals13/rlpoly.pdf">polynomial smoother</a> to the negative-test data to iron out daily fluctuations in reporting. The smoother is set to a pretty conservative setting, as we’re mostly interested in getting a sense of the broad directionality of a state’s testing regime &#8212; that is, whether tests are increasing quickly, increasing slowly, stagnant, or even declining. Outside of a state’s usable window, we use data for states that <i>did</i> have reliable reporting to estimate how fast test volume was increasing or decreasing. For instance, if Utah’s data did not become usable until March 20, but we know that the average state with usable data was doing 50 percent more testing on March 20 than on March 10, we can use that to extrapolate how much testing Utah may have been doing on March 10.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that &#8212; other than the first step &#8212; we apply this process only to a state’s reporting on <i>negative</i> tests, since reporting on positive tests is usually more timely and reliable.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="22" href="#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;That is, we take a state&rsquo;s positive tests reported &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; plus &lt;i&gt;smoothed&lt;/i&gt; negative tests, to estimate how many tests it actually did. Although this might sound like a cockamamie strategy, I think it&rsquo;s probably the least-worst option for trying to capture how many tests a state is actually doing at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-22">22</sup></a> The main issue with positive test reporting tends to be day-of-week effects: Some states tend to be better about reporting data on weekdays than on weekends. The simplest workaround for this is simply to look at one full week’s worth of data at a time, which is what we’ll do in the next section.</p>
<h2>Where coronavirus cases are growing and shrinking</h2>
<p>For each state, I’ve estimated the share of COVID-19 tests that produced positive results for the past five weeks &#8212; that is, for the seven-day periods ending on March 25, April 1, April 8, April 15 and April 22.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="23" href="#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Before March 25, the data is just too erratic in most states, even with all the adjustments that we might make.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-23">23</sup></a> All data, subject to the adjustments I described in the previous section, comes from <a href="https://covidtracking.com/">The COVID Tracking Project</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the states where things are still getting worse, or at least are not getting better &#8212; places where the share of positive tests hit a new high as of April 22.</p>

<p>Eighteen states and the District of Columbia made this list, which together are home to almost 95 million people. So if you hear something about how the situation is turning the corner in the U.S., that’s sort of a fiction. With so few people traveling, we’re really seeing a lot of statewide and local epidemics more than a national one, and some of those epidemics are still getting worse.</p>
<p>The states where cases are growing are somewhat varied, too &#8212; about evenly mixed between red states and blue states. They are mostly concentrated in the Midwest, although a series of Eastern Seaboard states &#8212; North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Delaware &#8212; also make the list. Connecticut is also on the list, which is something of a surprise since the turnaround is clear in neighboring New York.</p>
<p>On a percentage basis, the biggest week-over-week increases have been in Midwestern states, though: specifically Iowa, Ohio, Nebraska and North Dakota. But these increases aren’t necessarily uniformly distributed throughout the general population. <a href="https://time.com/5825030/ohio-mass-testing-prisons-coronavirus-outbreaks/">Ohio is having huge problems in its prisons</a>, and meat-processing plants have been <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/04/22/meat-packing-plants-covid-may-force-choice-worker-health-food/2995232001/">centers of outbreaks in states such as Iowa</a>. These outbreaks go to show the limitations of social distancing. It doesn’t work for people who can’t afford to do it, which means that even in places that seem to be controlling the outbreak, there can still be <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/27/a-new-doctor-faces-the-coronavirus-in-queens">huge numbers of cases among essential workers</a>.</p>
<p>Next up, states that have &#8212; at best &#8212; tentatively turned the corner, or where the peak of positive test rates came in the week that ended April 15.</p>

<p>Other than perhaps Alabama, where the share of positive tests fell from 12 percent a week ago to 8 percent this week, all of these states have made at best tentative progress and are only a percentage point or two off their peak of positive tests rates.</p>
<p>So in other words, in about half the country &#8212; the 18 states in the previous table plus most of the ones in this table and a couple in the next table &#8212; new coronavirus cases are still at or near their peak, after accounting for changes in testing volume.</p>
<p>But there are some encouraging stories: There are 20 states where positive test rates peaked two weeks ago, on April 8.</p>

<p>If you look at the data in more detail, though, it’s actually a bit of a mixed bag. Nevada, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Wisconsin are only tenuous members of this club; their rates of positive tests were nearly as high on April 22 as they were on April 8.</p>
<p>However, the decline in positive test rates has been more robust in New York, Louisiana and Michigan, all of which had very bad outbreaks before.</p>
<p>Florida and Georgia, controversial for their plans to reopen <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/florida-continues-reopening-beaches-with-social-distancing/2223461/">beaches</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/22/coronairus-trump-disagrees-georgia-gov-brian-kemp-reopening/3008524001/">businesses</a>, fall somewhere in between, with medium-sized decreases in positive test rates. Georgia has actually seen <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/state/georgia">a continued increase in its raw number of positive tests</a>, although it is doing more testing, so its share of positive tests has declined somewhat.</p>
<p>There are a number of Southern states on the declining list. Although the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/warm-weather-coronavirus.html">role that weather plays in the spread of COVID-19 is disputed</a>, it’s worth noting that late March was <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/la/kenner/KMSY/date/2020-3">fairly warm in states such as Louisiana</a>, which could have been a factor in these states.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a few states where the estimated rate of positive tests peaked <i>three</i> weeks ago, in the period ending on April 1.</p>

<p>Most of these states are in the West — and in the case of Washington and California, states that enacted fairly aggressive social distancing measures earlier because the coronavirus hit them sooner than other parts of the U.S. Although, it’s hard to know exactly what is happening in California given how erratic its reporting on negative tests has been.</p>
<p>Remote, geographically isolated states such as Montana and Maine (plus Alaska and Hawaii from the previous list) may have some advantages in containing the spread of COVID-19., though. Namely, they may be rural enough that human interaction is slightly less common. They’re also low-population states that never had terribly bad outbreaks, which <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/04/05/meet-the-team-of-alaskans-trying-to-trace-and-contain-every-case-of-covid-19/">may make “contact tracing” possible</a>, or the practice of finding and monitoring people exposed to the disease; this is easier to do when you have a finite number of cases.</p>
<h2>Where the fight against COVID-19 stands</h2>
<p>So, what to make of all of this &#8212; or at least, what to make of the states where the situation is not improving?</p>
<p>A week or two ago, we might have said just to give it more time since there’s a substantial lag between when people get infected and when their test shows up in the data. That <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/">lag is typically two or three weeks</a>, though. Since most of the country began implementing social distancing measures in mid-to-late March, we should see the effects of it in the data by now.</p>
<p>And in fact, we <i>do</i> see those effects of social distancing. Cases are decreasing in about half the country. In places where the data suggests COVID-19 cases are still increasing, they tend <i>not</i> to be increasing all that fast — especially when you compare where we are now to the exponential rates of spread we saw initially in New York and Louisiana, which reflected the period before social distancing measures were in place. Of course, the catch here is the spread would likely accelerate again if restrictions were lifted.</p>
<p>Additionally, while these social distancing efforts are almost certainly <i>flattening</i> the curve, the somewhat lax American version of social distancing may not be enough to <i>bend</i> the curve all on its own. In epidemiological terms, bending the curve means getting <i>R</i> &#8212; the <a href="https://www.healthknowledge.org.uk/public-health-textbook/research-methods/1a-epidemiology/epidemic-theory">effective reproduction number</a> &#8212; under 1, so that each person who acquires COVID-19 spreads it to less than one new person. If <i>R</i> is less than 1, a disease will begin to die out<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="24" href="#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;It will die out slowly, however, if R is just slightly below 1.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-24">24</sup></a>, but if it’s <i>above</i> 1, the disease will keep spreading. And if<i> R</i> is <i>near</i> 1, the curve will flatten into a long plateau but not turn downward, which may be the case in some states.</p>
<p>We must also consider the role of the essential workforce, since it doesn’t get the full benefits of social distancing like some of us do. If <i>R</i> is 0.6 among white-collar workers who can work from home, but 1.2 among U.S. Postal Service drivers, 1.7 among factory workers, 3.0 among nurses in hospitals and 4.6 among prison guards, the disease may continue to spread, but with that spread being concentrated among certain occupations and populations. Not that there is necessarily a better way around this, but carving out large categories of essential workers can make it hard for a community as whole to get its <i>R</i> below 1.</p>
<p>Indeed, the states where COVID-19 cases are decreasing often have some other helpful factors in addition to social distancing. As I mentioned, geographically isolated states seem to be doing better, as do warm-weather states. Because the outbreaks were <i>so</i> bad in New York and Louisiana, they may be benefiting from <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1252703694380040192?s=20"><i>some</i> degree of herd immunity</a>; enough people had COVID-19 there that it may be harder to spread it, assuming that they are immune. (Immunity is a complicated subject, but it’s likely that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-immunity.html">most people are immune for some period of time</a>.)<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="25" href="#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Note that herd immunity is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/21/facebook-posts/herd-immunity-curbed-covid-deaths-no/&quot;&gt;unlikely to be much help&lt;/a&gt; outside of the worst-affected regions such as New York and Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-25">25</sup></a>. These factors aren’t necessarily enormously important; warm weather is highly unlikely to be a cure-all, for instance. But something that’s enough to tip <i>R</i> from being just above 1 to just <i>below</i> 1 — say, from 1.15 to 0.85 — will have fairly noticeable effects over the course of a few weeks.</p>
<p>In short, the United States <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/its-not-too-late-to-go-on-offense-against-the-coronavirus">desperately needs to work on techniques <i>in addition</i> to social distancing</a> to fight the spread, including better testing, case-tracking, quarantining of sick individuals, and better sanitation and hygiene. Social distancing has likely been very helpful to slow the spread and, in many states, even reverse it. But if it’s the <i>only</i> tool we’re employing &#8212; and it’s a costly tool to wield &#8212; it may only be enough to allow us to fight the coronavirus to a draw.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rank-and-file Republican voters are still generally supportive of social distancing and other measures to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, even after <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/hundreds-protest-michigan-governors-social-distancing-order-70171015">conservative protesters</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/coronavirus-rules-protests.html">several states</a>, some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/17/coronavirus-latest-news/">conservatives elites</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-governors.html">President Trump</a> have denounced virus-related restrictions.</p>
<p>Polls over the past month found that Republicans were <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/15/poll-dont-stop-social-distancing-coronavirus-spread-187290">less supportive of such measures</a> than Democrats, but they were still in favor overall. For most of that period, though, there wasn’t really a vocal movement arguing <i>against</i> social distancing. That changed toward the end of last week, particularly with the protests, which were fairly small but got a lot of media coverage. In the wake of the protests and Trump’s support of them, I had expected conservative and Republican voters to become more opposed to social distancing since <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-impeachment-more-popular-because-of-ukraine-or-because-voters-are-sheep/">voters often take cues</a> from party leaders and elites.</p>
<p>But they haven’t so far.</p>
<h2><b> A plurality of rank-and-file Republicans don’t agree with the protesters. </b></h2>
<p>Forty-seven percent of Republicans oppose the protesters who are criticizing social distancing, compared with 36 percent who support them, according to a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/rjneitr3jm/20200419_yahoo_coronavirus_crosstabs.pdf">Yahoo/YouGov survey</a> conducted Friday through Sunday. When asked whether they were more supportive of the governor of their state or more supportive of the protesters in terms of stay-at-home orders, 62 percent of Republicans said they supported their governor more, compared with 26 percent who aligned with the protesters, per <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Navigator-Daily-Tracker-Topline-F04.20.20.pdf">polling</a> conducted Saturday through Monday by the left-leaning survey research firm <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/about/">Navigator Research</a>. To date at least, the protesters do <i>not</i> represent a majority view in the Republican Party, let alone the country as a whole. You can also see this when you look at polling data on the issues under debate, protests aside. For instance …</p>
<h2><b>Republicans still favor social distancing.</b></h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2020/04/20/5e9e1857c5b63c5b58734cc0.pdf">HuffPost/YouGov survey</a> conducted Friday through Sunday, only 25 percent of Republicans said there were too many coronavirus-related restrictions in the area where they live, while 52 percent said there were “about the right number” of restrictions. For comparison, just 6 percent of Democrats said there were too many restrictions, 60 percent said the current number of restrictions was appropriate, and 29 percent said there were not enough restrictions.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Navigator-Daily-Tracker-Topline-F04.20.20.pdf">Navigator Research polling</a> found that 51 percent of Republicans agreed that “we are currently doing the right thing when it comes to social distancing,” compared with 24 percent who favor <i>more</i> aggressive social distancing and just 21 percent who want fewer restrictions.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="26" href="#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Navigator data cited earlier, this polling was conducted Friday, Monday and Tuesday. We wanted to publish the most up-to-date information possible.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-26">26</sup></a></p>
<p>When asked about shelter-in-place orders, only 32 percent of Republicans thought “the cure is worse than the disease,” according to the Yahoo/YouGov survey. This compares with 68 percent who think that implementing those orders is the only way to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>And finally, a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nj_042120.pdf/">Monmouth University poll</a> of New Jersey residents conducted last Thursday through Sunday found that at least 80 percent of Republicans in the state support limiting restaurants to take-out and delivery orders only, banning large gatherings and closing gyms, libraries, child care centers and schools amid the virus outbreak.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="27" href="#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;We are using a survey of New Jersey simply because this is one of the most recent polls released. New Jersey is Democratic-leaning, but the state&rsquo;s Republicans &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls/new-jersey/president&quot;&gt;overwhelmingly voted for Trump&lt;/a&gt; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-27">27</sup></a></p>
<p>In short, survey research has consistently shown that most Republicans support social distancing right now. However …</p>
<h2><b>Republicans are more divided over how long social distancing should last and its potential effect on the economy. </b></h2>
<p>When asked in the HuffPost/YouGov survey whether they were more concerned that states would lift the stay-at-home orders too quickly or not quickly enough, 46 percent of Republicans said too quickly compared with 42 percent who said not quickly enough.</p>
<p>Per the Navigator poll, Republicans are also about equally divided between two camps: those most worried that coronavirus restrictions will last too long “and cause unnecessary damage to the economy and Americans’ livelihoods” (40 percent) and those most worried that “social distancing will end too soon and prolong the epidemic” (45 percent). Similarly, according to the Yahoo/YouGov survey, 51 percent of Republicans think the U.S. should “reopen” when “public health officials are fully able to test and trace new cases and outbreaks,” while 49 percent favor reopening “as soon as possible to prevent further economic damage.”</p>
<p>So when the issue is put explicitly into an economic context and people are asked to project into the future, GOP support for the current restrictions drops &#8212; but only to a point where the issue divides the party pretty evenly.</p>
<h2><b>All this could change</b>.</h2>
<p>It’s worth noting that at least one survey suggests Republicans are <i>trending</i> toward disapproving of social distancing, perhaps motivated by party elites. An <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/despite-scattered-protests-most-americans-support-shelter-in-place-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN22336P">Ipsos-Reuters survey</a> conducted April 15-21 found that 55 percent of Republicans supported stay-at-home orders compared with 45 percent who said those orders should be lifted to get the economy going again. But the share of Republicans who want the orders lifted has increased substantially from the previous Ipsos-Reuters poll, conducted March 30-31, when only 24 percent of Republicans favored lifting them.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="28" href="#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;HuffPost/YouGov polling has not shown this trend. Their surveys suggest that the overwhelming majority of &lt;a href=&quot;https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2020/04/20/5e9e1857c5b63c5b58734cc0.pdf&quot;&gt;Republicans back stay-at-home orders&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2020/04/07/5e8cfcd3c5b62459a9308880.pdf&quot;&gt;opposition has not substantially increased&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-28">28</sup></a></p>
<p>We could, in other words, see Republican views aligning more closely with those of Trump and the conservative voices backing the protests. Why, then, aren’t those voters <i>already</i> taking cues from them? The simplest (and probably best) explanation is that rank-and-file Republicans support social distancing on its merits &#8212; in this case taking the view of public health experts over voices they usually align with politically. But it’s also worth noting that ending social distancing and other measures intended to stop the spread of COVID-19 is a position that conservative elites are not unified around. For example, Sen. Lindsey Graham, normally a stalwart Trump ally, has <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1252643578418991104">expressed wariness</a> about lifting coronavirus-related restrictions too soon.</p>
<p>Even the White House has been sending mixed messages. Trump has been sympathetic toward the anti-social-distancing protesters, but he has not made a full-throated case against coronavirus-related restrictions. (In fact, on Wednesday night, Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/22/politics/trump-pence-georgia-governor-brian-kemp/index.html">criticized Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp</a> for not keeping some restrictions in place, surprising some, including the governor and his staff.) And Trump has allowed figures in his administration, most notably Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to continue to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-04-21/dr-anthony-fauci-explains-why-quarantined-mlb-games-new-normal-coronavirus">strongly advocate for social distancing</a> measures.</p>
<p>So even if Republican voters were taking cues from conservative leaders, those cues aren’t pointing all in one direction &#8212; at least right now.</p>
<p>That said, Trump and the GOP activists wary of social distancing likely created the<i> impression</i> of deep conservative discontent with aggressive measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. And that impression &#8212; and the party’s loyalty to Trump and business owners &#8212; may spur more conservative politicians to take steps to end social distancing, or at least advocate for doing so. The states that are already <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/states-moving-reopen-continued-health-concerns/story?id=70264419">moving most quickly</a> to end virus-related restrictions &#8212; over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/21/georgia-mayors-brian-kemp-republican-coronavirus">objections of some local officials</a> &#8212; are mostly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/22/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-economy/index.html">Republican-led</a>. Attorney General William Barr is hinting at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-21/barr-says-doj-may-act-against-governors-with-strict-virus-limits">filing lawsuits against states</a> with restrictions that he views as too strict. So rank-and-file Republicans haven’t yet been moved en masse to oppose social distancing &#8212; but anti-social-distancing conservatives may be getting what they want even if most Republicans don’t support those goals. And GOP voters may move more firmly against social distancing measures if cues from party elites start to point more universally in that direction.</p>
