										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With so many people across the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html">cooped up inside</a> to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, it isn’t surprising that video gaming is on the rise these past few months. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/us-video-game-usage-up-45-percent-nielsen-reports-1288738">According to Nielsen</a>, play time was up by 45 percent during the last week of March, while worldwide <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-03-28-what-is-happening-with-video-game-sales-during-coronavirus">sales were up at least 44 percent</a>. Although a lot of that includes the popular new <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing game</a>, which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-22-animal-crossing-new-horizons-broke-record-for-most-digital-units-sold-in-a-single-month">sold a record 5 million digital copies</a> since its release, it also includes sports games &#8212; the likes of which leagues have increasingly embraced in the absence of real contests. ESPN aired the <a href="https://nba.2k.com/en-US/news/first-ever-nba-2k-players-tournament/">NBA 2K20 Players Tournament</a> in April, while baseball players <a href="https://dknation.draftkings.com/mlb/2020/4/11/21217785/mlb-the-show-players-tournament-2020-results-standings-video-schedule">have an entire MLB The Show league</a> airing on Twitch and YouTube.</p>
<p>In other words, there’s probably never been a better opportunity to play sports video games than right now. The only thing keeping this from being a true golden age is simply that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2evYnzSVAQ">sports gaming itself is in the doldrums</a>. Sports gamers have fewer choices now than ever before, and the games they’re left with — while typically <i>looking </i>great on current-gen consoles — have stalled out in quality, eliciting fan revolts over a lack of innovation and a frequent use of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJi2rwUXt3Y">microtransaction services</a>.</p>
<p>Take EA Sports’ <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/madden/">storied Madden series</a> of NFL games, for example. Sales numbers <a href="https://equity.guru/2019/08/14/electronic-arts-ea-q-madden-20-release-breaks-franchise-records/">were once again through the roof</a> after Madden 20 released last summer, but the game recorded a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/madden-nfl-20">Metascore of 76</a> according to the review-aggregation site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a> &#8212; the worst in the franchise since at least 2000<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="1" href="#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;The earliest year of data in Metacritic&rsquo;s archive.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a> &#8212; and an abysmal user score of 1.6, which Metacritic says corresponds to “overwhelming dislike.” The most recent Madden scores are far below those of the previous versions of the game and of its now-defunct major competitor, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_2K">NFL 2K</a> series.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="2" href="#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;To find the score of each installment of each game, I used the version on the primary console (XBox or PlayStation &amp;#8212; sorry, Nintendo) that came out earliest in its generation, in order to give developers a longer production runway for a new console before grading them. In other words, that means I used the PlayStation 2 version in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_generation_of_video_game_consoles&quot;&gt;sixth generation&lt;/a&gt; of consoles, the Xbox 360 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_generation_of_video_game_consoles&quot;&gt;seventh generation&lt;/a&gt; and the PlayStation 4 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_generation_of_video_game_consoles&quot;&gt;eighth generation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a></p>

					<img class="size-full wp-image-271486" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Paine-sports-video-games-0501-1.png" alt="" width="575" height="512" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Paine-sports-video-games-0501-1.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Paine-sports-video-games-0501-1.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>The same goes for 2K Sports’ NBA 2K series. Its latest edition, NBA 2K20, received a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/nba-2k20">Metascore of 78</a> &#8212; also the lowest in the franchise since at least 2000 &#8212; and an absurdly low user score of 1.0. That continues a trend of low fan ratings that began with NBA 2K18, one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k18-is-riddled-with-microtransactions-1818554307">most infamously microtransaction-laden offerings</a> in gaming history.</p>
<figure id="attachment_271485" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-271485" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Paine-sports-video-games-0429-0501-2.png" alt="" width="575" height="520" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Paine-sports-video-games-0429-0501-2.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Paine-sports-video-games-0429-0501-2.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>Meanwhile, EA Sports’ FIFA 20 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/fifa-20">was savaged</a> with a 1.1 user score, and its Metascore dipped below 80 for the first time since at least 2000.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="3" href="#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;The only other main series game under 70 was FIFA 07 for Xbox 360, but that was a transitional version between consoles. (FIFA 07 for the PS2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/fifa-07-soccer&quot;&gt;got an 82&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-3">3</sup></a> Even the venerated EA NHL series, which was once <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaAtavKP0-4">a pop-culture touchstone</a>, saw a subpar Metascore (77) and one of its worst-ever user ratings (3.6) with NHL 20 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/nhl-20">this year</a>. Among the major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)">triple-A</a> sports game franchises, only the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-baseball-video-game-championship-belt/">reigning champion</a> of baseball games, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/mlb-the-show-20">Sony’s MLB The Show</a>, has escaped the season with both a relatively sturdy Metascore (83) and a solid-enough average user rating (6.9).</p>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ghostbusters-is-a-perfect-example-of-how-internet-ratings-are-broken/">Online review-bombing happens</a>, which means we should always tread lightly with user scores. But in this case, there’s no obvious underlying political motivation for downvoting these games — just frustration with products that have de facto licensing monopolies and haven’t improved much in this generation of consoles but have made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ywdh1on_HU">expansive monetization schemes</a> the norm.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, it wasn’t uncommon to see each major league sell its license to multiple publishers at the same time, across multiple consoles. For instance, in 2002 alone, there were <i>four </i>pro football simulation games available on the PS2 or Xbox &#8212; Madden, NFL 2K3, NFL GameDay and NFL Fever &#8212; plus an arcade option (NFL Blitz 20-03) and a more kid-friendly offering (Backyard Football) as well. The variety meant gamers had options to choose from; if Madden didn’t suit their style of play, they weren’t simply stuck with it. And the competition meant that each game had to improve over time, which led to the addition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrS7RY3LSqE">countless new features</a> &#8212; ones that Madden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X0Psm5aWu8">has been known to recycle</a> even today.</p>
<p>The exact moment when that period ended came in 2005, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/big-deal-ea-and-nfl-ink-exclusive-licensing-agreement/1100-6114977/">EA cut a deal with the NFL</a> to secure exclusive rights to the league’s license. This <a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-moment-madden-nfl-killed-nfl-2k-forever">effectively killed</a> the popular NFL 2K series, denying it the chance to compete with Madden on a level playing field. For its part, 2K Sports followed suit shortly thereafter with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-inks-agreement-with-mlb-players-association/1100-6116946/">MLB exclusivity agreement</a> that all but killed EA Sports’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWSExFHtPRQ">beloved MVP Baseball series</a>.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="4" href="#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;EA released &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVP_Baseball_series#MVP:_NCAA_Baseball&quot;&gt;two college baseball games&lt;/a&gt; under the MVP banner before shuttering the brand for good.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></a> Market forces brought further winnowing, as the competition became more cutthroat going into the 2010s: NBA 2K dominated the once-great NBA Live series so thoroughly that EA <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/3/20946839/nba-live-canceled-ea-sports-pc-ps4-xbox-one-nba-2k20">canceled multiple installments of the series</a> (including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/29/20938853/nba-live-20-canceled-ea-sports-ps4-xbox-one-ps5-scarlett">NBA Live 20</a>), while The Show was the last full-fledged baseball simulation left standing after 2K’s much-maligned Major League Baseball series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-01-06-mlb-2k-baseball-series-canceled.html">was unceremoniously discontinued</a> in 2014. Konami’s long-running <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/efootball-pes-2020">Pro Evolution Soccer</a> series is essentially the only major foil an EA, 2K or Sony first-party sports game has in 2020.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="5" href="#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not coincidentally, PES 2020 outrated FIFA at Metacritic.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a></p>
<p>You can forget about college sports games nowadays, too. After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Bannon_v._NCAA">O’Bannon v. NCAA</a> ruling found the NCAA had violated antitrust laws when it allowed video games to use former college players’ likenesses without financial compensation, EA Sports pulled the plug on its well-received <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Football_(video_game_series)">NCAA Football series</a>. (2K and EA had both <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/86183/the-college-basketball-video-game-is-dead">discontinued their respective college basketball series</a> a few years earlier.) It’s difficult to argue that justice wasn’t served when District Judge Claudia Wilken <a href="https://www.hausfeld.com/uploads/documents/2015.09.30_NCAA_Opinion.pdf">issued her verdict</a> in 2014, but the decision effectively eradicated an entire subgenre of sports video gaming in the process.</p>
<p>At the same time, true arcade-style sports games are only now starting to reemerge <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/4/26/5650166/whatever-happened-to-the-arcade-style-sports-video-game">after years of hibernation</a>. (Though for every indie title like <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/super-mega-baseball">Super Mega Baseball</a>, which has thrived despite the lack of an MLB license, other arcade offerings <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/nba-playgrounds">haven’t quite</a> <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/rbi-baseball-20">pulled off</a> <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/mutant-football-league-dynasty-edition">that feat</a>.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour_(video_game_series)">Tiger Woods PGA Tour</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Street_(series)">NBA Street</a> are but distant memories. There hasn’t been a Backyard Sports release on the Xbox or PlayStation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard_Sports#Games_in_the_series">since 2010</a>. And the extreme-sports genre, which once gave us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Radio">Jet Grind Radio</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSX_(series)">SSX</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skate_(video_game)">EA Skate</a> and the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_(series)">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</a> series &#8212; along with its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IZ2gFMQzno">many clones</a> &#8212; is <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion-30/the-birth-death-and-rebirth-of-extreme-sports-game-1799395/">struggling to regain relevance</a>.</p>
<p>Add it all up, and the present state of sports video gaming is arguably the weakest it’s ever been when we need it most &#8212; both as a diversion from the pandemic outside and also as a legitimate replacement for the on-field action we’re all missing.</p>
<p>It isn’t as though things were perfect in the earlier days of sports video gaming. Many of the alternative choices in each sport were unable to find a sizable fan base, eventually dying because they weren’t worth the cost and trouble. Maybe the market was always going to consolidate around just a few monolithic options sooner or later &#8212; particularly as major-studio budgets have steadily increased, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/10/31/why-have-video-game-budgets-skyrocketed-in-recent-years/#7c25298e3ea5">squeezing out midtier developers</a>. This trend <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-video-games-cost-so-much-to-make-1818508211">has been playing out</a> across all genres of gaming, not just in sports. The same can be said of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022216/how-microtransactions-are-evolving-economics-gaming.asp">aggressive microtransactions</a> and the move toward so-called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUAX0gnZ3Nw">games as a service</a>. Those new realities would have been difficult to avoid even in an alternate universe in which MVP Baseball and The Show were allowed to go head-to-head, and NFL 2K had an annual release right next to Madden on the PlayStation store’s virtual shelf.</p>
<p>But just the same, today’s sports gamers are clearly unhappy with the set of options in front of them. The lack of competition and choice &#8212; in some cases contractually mandated &#8212; is leading to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-201908071233--tms--invideogctnzs-a20190807-20190807-story.html">stagnant</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wQKwt6MrMo">broken</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy-g14tsEK0">bug-riddled</a> products, in which the focus seems to be more on <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifa-madden-game-purchasing-fuels-revenue-boost-ea-1250797">money-grabbing “ultimate team” modes</a> than exciting features and realistic gameplay. At a moment when sports video games ought to be taking center stage, it’s hard not to think of how much better suited an earlier era of gaming would have been to take on this limelight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When there is a gap in our knowledge, it’s only human for us to try to fill that void with information.

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html">Tara Reade says</a> that in 1993, then-Sen. Joe Biden pressed her up against a wall in the United States Senate, kissed her neck and hair, slid his hand under her blouse, then used his knee to spread her legs and penetrated her with his fingers. Biden <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/joe-biden-this-is-an-open-book-there-is-nothing-for-me-to-hide-82865221937?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma">denied the allegations</a> Friday: “I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened.”</p>
<p>The country has spent four years in a messy reckoning over sexual assault, harassment and accountability. Every high-profile case has been argued on its own terms, and Biden’s will be no different. But past instances of sexual assault allegations in politics have shown that it’s party officials who help decide whether a politician weathers the storm. If precedent tells us anything, it’s that establishment Democrats will help determine whether Reade’s account has any impact on Biden’s campaign. In politics, believing women is complicated.</p>
<p>Biden isn’t a stranger to accusations that he’s made women uncomfortable. Last year, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/04/joe-biden-accuser-accusations-allegations.html">a number of women alleged</a> that he invaded their personal space in ways that felt inappropriate, if not sexual &#8212; though some felt his touching was indeed sexual. Reade was among those who came forward with an account, though at the time she did not relate her allegation that Biden had pressed her against the wall.</p>
<p>The public reaction to the initial allegations was muted. A <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/poll-democrats-unfazed-by-joe-bidens-handsiness-1264132?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=0000014e-f115-dd93-ad7f-f91513e50001&amp;nlid=630318">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> of Democratic voters found that half of respondents said the allegations would have no bearing on whether they’d decide to support Biden, and 32 percent of Democrats said that he hadn’t behaved inappropriately at all. <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/437552-poll-voters-believe-bidens-conduct-with-women-should-not">The Hill and HarrisX ran a poll</a> around the same time that found that 62 percent of Democrats said the allegations shouldn’t preclude his presidential ambitions.</p>
<p>Of course, Reade’s new allegations are quite different from the ones Biden faced last year. Vaginal penetration falls under the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape">Justice Department’s definition of rape</a>.</p>
<p>In many ways, Biden is in a precarious political position with his Democratic base. The party has squared itself firmly behind the “believe women” ethos of the MeToo movement, and Democratic voters have consistently showed less tolerance for sexual misconduct and assault. A <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/04/04/sexual-harassment-at-work-in-the-era-of-metoo/">Pew Research Center survey from 2018</a> found that 62 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents thought that men getting away with sexual harassment was a major problem and 60 percent said the same about women not being believed when they lodge harassment claims. Those numbers were about double the share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who said those issues were major problems.</p>
<p>There was a similar partisan gap when Christine Blasey Ford and others accused Justice Brett Kavanaugh of past sexual misconduct. An <a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/662519588/poll-reveals-divided-understanding-of-metoo">NPR/Ipsos survey</a> conducted in October 2018, a month after Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, found 75 percent of Republicans thought the MeToo movement had gone too far, but only 21 percent of Democrats thought so.</p>
<p>The question, of course, is whether numbers like those will hold when a Democrat is involved. For example, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/battleground-house-districts-remain-close-in-new-poll/2018/10/22/e6c77a32-d63e-11e8-aeb7-ddcad4a0a54e_story.html">Washington Post-Schar School poll</a> conducted shortly after the Kavanaugh hearings found that 76 percent of Republicans were concerned that men could be accused unfairly of sexual assault. Only 34 percent of Democrats felt the same. Theoretically, that could mean trouble for Biden.</p>
<p>But Democrats’ principled stance on sexual misconduct can soften a little &#8212; or at least get more complicated &#8212; when it comes to members of their own party. Sen. Al Franken resigned in 2017 after Leeann Tweeden alleged he forcibly kissed her during a USO tour and a photo appeared to show him groping her while she slept. In November of 2017, 59 percent of Democratic survey respondents in a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2017/11/22/voters-take-hard-line-on-sexual-misconduct-as-allegations-mount/">Morning Consult/Politico poll</a> said elected officials &#8212; generically &#8212; should resign if faced with credible allegations of misconduct. But only 49 percent of Democrats in the same survey were in favor of Franken, specifically, resigning. A <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/361490-poll-22-percent-of-minnesotans-say-franken-should-remain-in-office">KSTP/SurveyUSA poll</a> of Minnesotans from the same time found 34 percent of Democrats said he should remain in office, 14 percent thought he should resign and 46 percent thought he should wait for the results of an ethics investigation.</p>
<p>But while Democratic constituents waffled, Democratic elected officials were more decisive. In early December 2017, a group of Franken’s Democratic Senate colleagues, led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/06/gillibrand-calls-on-franken-to-resign-282112">demanded he resign</a>. <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/07/franken-resigns-285957">Franken did so a day later</a>, his fate sealed by his colleagues’ loss of confidence.</p>
<p>Franken’s case shows that what can truly sound the death knell of a politician’s run is the loss of support from party insiders; the condemnation of one’s peers is a damning thing in this line of work. After the “Access Hollywood” tape revealed that Donald Trump had bragged about making unwanted advances on women, some Republicans, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/paul-ryan-told-gop-it-could-abandon-trump-after-access-hollywood-tape-book">including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan</a>, abandoned him. But he maintained the backing of powerful allies like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and, luckily for Trump, his scandal broke close enough to Election Day that Republicans had few viable choices to replace him.</p>
<p>So far, Democrats seem to be following a similar playbook, perhaps because Biden is running against Trump. The president has been accused of sexual assault &#8212; including rape &#8212; <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/list-trumps-accusers-allegations-sexual-misconduct/story?id=51956410">by 17 women</a>. Even if the accusations against Biden are true, Democrats might be willing to rationalize voting for him if they perceive him as the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>Democratic officials have closed ranks around Biden even as Reade’s allegations have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-neighbor-corroborates-joe-bidens-accuser-2020-4">received further</a> attention and reporting. When asked about Reade’s allegations, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-joe-biden-support/index.html">Gillibrand said</a>, “I support Vice President Biden.”</p>
<p>The political cover that Biden already built for himself by declaring that he would choose a female vice president &#8212; a consolation prize of sorts for voters disappointed by their white, male de facto nominee &#8212; is paying off as his campaign fights Reade’s allegations. Potential vice presidential picks have, so far, not come out against Biden. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said, “I think this case has been investigated,” and talked about Biden’s record on helping victims of domestic abuse. Another senator in the vice presidential running, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rubycramer/joe-biden-tara-reade-talking-points-campaign-defense">Kamala Harris, said</a> Reade “has a right to tell her story” and that she could “only speak to the Joe Biden I know. He’s been a lifelong fighter, in terms of stopping violence against women.” <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/495340-democrats-begin-to-confront-biden-allegations">Stacey Abrams</a>, another vice presidential contender, said, “I know Joe Biden, and I think he’s telling the truth and this did not happen.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/developments-in-allegations-against-biden-amplify-efforts-to-question-his-behavior/2020/04/27/88869bc2-88be-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html">Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</a>, herself a survivor of rape and another name that has been batted about in vice presidential speculation, was slightly more circumspect when asked about Reade: “Well, I think women should be able to tell their stories. I think that it is important that these allegations are vetted, from the media to beyond. And I think that, you know, it is something that no one takes lightly,” Whitmer said. “But it is also something that is, you know, personal. And so it’s hard to give you greater insight than that, not knowing more about the situation.”</p>
<p>The Biden campaign <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rubycramer/joe-biden-tara-reade-talking-points-campaign-defense">sent out talking points</a> this week for surrogates who will need to address the Reade question. “Here’s the bottom line: Vice President Joe Biden has spent over 40 years in public life: 36 years in the Senate; 7 Senate campaigns, 2 previous presidential runs, two vice presidential campaigns, and 8 years in the White House. There has never been a complaint, allegation, hint or rumor of any impropriety or inappropriate conduct like this regarding him – ever.”</p>
<p>The plan for now, it would appear, is to deny, deny, deny and encourage Democratic officials to do the same. In the political world, that calculus isn’t half bad and has worked to great effect: President Trump, it should be noted, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/list-trumps-accusers-allegations-sexual-misconduct/story?id=51956410">continues to deny</a> all 17 assault claims against him.</p>

<h2>Riddler Express</h2>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-help-dakota-jones-raid-the-lost-arc/">Dakota Jones</a> is back in action. In her quest to locate the Temple of Diametra, she has found another highly symmetric crystal. However, nefarious agents have again gotten wind of her plans, and now Dakota and the crystal are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>And so, you must once again recreate the crystal using the data from Dakota’s laser scanner. As a reminder, the scanner takes a 3D object and records 2D cross-sectional slices along the third dimension. Here’s the looping animation file the scanner produced for the crystal <i>this</i> time:</p>

<h2>Riddler Classic</h2>
<p>From Bart Wright comes a rhetorical question from a famed soliloquy, “To flip, or not to flip?”:</p>
<p>You are locked in the dungeon of a faraway castle with three fellow prisoners (i.e., there are four prisoners in total), each in a separate cell with no means of communication. But it just so happens that all of you are logicians (of course).</p>
<p>To entertain themselves, the guards have decided to give you all a single chance for immediate release. Each prisoner will be given a fair coin, which can either be fairly flipped one time or returned to the guards without being flipped. If all flipped coins come up heads, you will all be set free! But if any of the flipped coins comes up tails, or if no one chooses to flip a coin, you will all be doomed to spend the rest of your lives in the castle’s dungeon.</p>
<p>The only tools you and your fellow prisoners have to aid you are random number generators, which will give each prisoner a random number, uniformly and independently chosen between zero and one.</p>
<p>What are your chances of being released?</p>
<p><i>Extra credit:</i> Instead of four prisoners, suppose there are <i>N</i> prisoners. Now what are your chances of being released?</p>

<h2>Solution to last week’s Riddler Express</h2>
<p>Congratulations to <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44f.png" alt="👏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Tony Jackson <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44f.png" alt="👏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> of Rohnert Park, California, winner of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-beat-the-goat-monty-hall-problem/">last week’s Riddler Express</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, you and a friend were grilling two small square burger patties whose sides were 5 centimeters long. However, you only had one slice of cheese remaining, which was also square and whose sides were 7 centimeters long. You wanted to cut the slice so that all of the cheese was evenly split between the two patties, and no cheese was spilling over either patty and onto the grill.</p>
<p>What was the smallest number of cuts you needed to make? (You could only make straight cuts, and you were asked to assume that the cheese was stationary during the cutting process.)</p>
<p>First off, several solvers thought to stack layers of cheese on top of each other. If stacking had been allowed, then with just two cuts you could have sliced the larger square into four smaller squares, each of whose sides were 3.5 centimeters long. (You even could have made a single cut down the middle and then have folded each half into quarters.) While stacking wasn’t explicitly prohibited in the original puzzle, finding a solution that resulted in a single layer of cheese on the patty was a more interesting challenge.</p>
<p>If you restricted your cuts so they were parallel to the sides of the square, then you needed at least four cuts. Solver Michael Smith found one such way to do this:</p>
<div class="non-jetpack-embed ">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My solution to this week’s <a href="https://twitter.com/FiveThirtyEight?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FiveThirtyEight</a> riddler (N=4) about cheese looks much less  appetizing in Excel format. <a href="https://twitter.com/xaqwg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@xaqwg</a> <a href="https://t.co/f6UeR9Kp8o">pic.twitter.com/f6UeR9Kp8o</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But with diagonal slicing, you only needed <b>two cuts</b>. The puzzle’s creator, Andrew Heairet, cut along the main diagonals of the cheese and then rearranged the resulting quarters into two squares that each had an area of 24.5 square centimeters &#8212; just enough to fit onto a single patty. Andrew was even kind enough to illustrate this solution:</p>
<figure id="attachment_271357" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="wp-image-271357" src='https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burger_gif_static.gif' data-animate='https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burger.gif' data-autoplay='1' alt="D" width="472" height="460" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burger_gif_static.gif?w=472 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burger_gif_static.gif?w=944 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>Solver Jason White arrived at the same result, but went the extra mile of cutting a real slice of cheese!</p>
<figure id="attachment_271358" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="wp-image-271358" src='https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burger2_gif_static.gif' data-animate='https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burger2.gif' data-autoplay='1' alt="Diagonal cuts and rearrangement of an actual slice of cheese" width="324" height="442" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burger2_gif_static.gif?w=324 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/burger2_gif_static.gif?w=648 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>But that wasn’t the only way to cut the cheese! Solver <a href="https://imgur.com/a/YpKgV50">Ethan Rubin</a> found a whole class of additional two-cut solutions by rotating the diagonal cuts:</p>
<figure id="attachment_271361" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-271361" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rubin_cheese.png" alt="Rotated diagonal cuts of a slice of cheese, which still result in two pieces that fit on smaller square patties." width="575" height="256" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rubin_cheese.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rubin_cheese.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>According to Ethan, as long as the diagonal cuts were within about 8.13 degrees of the diagonal, the resulting quarters could still be rearranged to form two cheesy toppings that stayed on the patties.</p>
<p>Delicious!</p>

<p>Last week, you tried your hand at a variation of the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-randomness-rules-our-world/">Monty Hall problem</a>. This time, Monty randomly picked a number of goats to put behind the doors: zero, one, two or three, each with a 25 percent chance. After the number of goats was chosen, they were assigned to the doors at random, and each door had at most one goat. Any doors that didn’t have a goat behind them had an identical prize behind them.</p>
<p>At this point, you chose a door. If Monty was able to open another door, revealing a goat, he would do so. But if no other doors had goats behind them, he would tell you that was the case.</p>
<p>It just so happened that when you played, Monty was able to open another door, revealing a goat behind it. Should you have stayed with your original selection or switched? And what were your chances of winning the prize?</p>
<p>It helped to break the problem down into four cases, one for each possible number of goats:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">If there were three goats behind the doors, it didn’t matter if you switched or stayed &#8212; you’d always lose.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">If there were two goats behind the doors, then this reverted to the original Monty Hall problem. You had a two-thirds chance of winning the prize if you switched, but just a one-third chance of winning if you stayed.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">If there was one goat behind a door, then Monty just did you a huge favor by showing you which door it was behind. It didn’t matter if you switched or stayed &#8212; you’d always win.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">If there were zero goats behind the doors, then you’d always win.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you might have thought that each of these cases was equally likely &#8212; but wait just a minute! The fact that Monty was even <i>able</i> to open a door and reveal a goat meant you couldn’t have been in the zero-goat scenario. There had to have been at least one goat present.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t all. The trickiest part of the problem was around the relative likelihood of the one-goat scenario. If there had been two or three goats, then no matter which door you picked, Monty could always open a different door to reveal a goat. But if there was only one goat, then the one-third of the time you happened to pick that goat’s door, Monty wouldn’t have been able to open another door to reveal a goat.</p>
<p>All of that meant you were just two-thirds as likely to be in the one-goat scenario as you were to be in the two-goat or three-goat scenarios. In other words, the probability there were three goats was 3/8, the probability there were two goats was also 3/8, and the probability there was one goat was just 2/8.</p>
<p>By combining the probabilities of the different scenarios with your probability of winning the prize within each scenario, you found that, overall, you had a <b>50 percent chance of winning if you switched</b>, but just a 37.5 percent chance of winning if you stayed.</p>
<p>Solver <a href="https://github.com/geoffrey4444/RiddlerGoat/blob/master/RiddlerMonteHall.ipynb">Geoffrey Lovelace</a> verified these results by running a few hundred thousand computer simulations. And <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ia2q3sqkqggpgmnJWrAWV_7i1ZpKA5HJ">David Zimmerman</a>, meanwhile, extended the problem by looking at the general case where there were <i>N</i> doors (rather than just three), with anywhere from zero to <i>N</i> goats behind those doors. He found that switching always gave you a 50 percent chance of winning the prize, no matter how many doors there were. However, your probability of winning when you stayed with your original door was <i>N</i>/(2(<i>N</i>+1)) &#8212; a value that’s always less than 50 percent.</p>
<p>And so, as with the original Monty Hall problem, your best bet was to switch doors. That is, unless <a href="https://xkcd.com/1282/">a goat happens to be your idea of a prize</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>
<h2><b>Poll(s) of the week </b></h2>
<p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, leads President Trump in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/">most national polls</a>, and surveys conducted even this far out have tended to roughly resemble the eventual general election results, as FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-can-pay-attention-to-those-trump-vs-biden-polls-but-be-cautious/">explained in an article this week</a>. Of course, national polls measure the national popular vote, which is really only <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-odds-of-an-electoral-college-popular-vote-split-are-increasing/">indirectly related</a> to who will win the White House &#8212; Democrats have won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College in <a href="https://time.com/5579161/presidents-elected-electoral-college/">two of the last seven elections</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/how-trump-could-lose-5-million-votes-still-win-2020-n1031601">could do so again in 2020</a>. U.S. presidential elections are really a contest of states.</p>
<p>So what’s going on in the states? We thought it was worth taking a look at that question now, as April featured some high-quality, state-level polling (though not a ton of it<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="7" href="#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;There were only 41 total polls of just 19 states released in April, at least by &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&rsquo;s count&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-7">7</sup></a>). It also happened to be the month when the general election came into sharper focus: It’s now clear who the Democratic nominee will be and that the novel coronavirus pandemic will be a major part of the campaign.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="8" href="#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;One caution, though: The coronavirus outbreak and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/27/mccourt-trumps-coronavirus-leadership-awful-for-us-and-the-world.html&quot;&gt;criticism of Trump&rsquo;s handling of it&lt;/a&gt; might make April a particularly unfavorable month to assess his chances of winning reelection. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-8">8</sup></a></p>
<p>Here’s what we learned looking at every state-level poll conducted in April:<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="9" href="#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;We included polls in which some of the respondents were contacted in late March but the full survey was not finished until April. We thought that made sense for two reasons. First, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-does-biden-need-sanders-voters-to-beat-trump/&quot;&gt;late March&lt;/a&gt;, it was fairly clear that Biden would be the Democratic nominee. Second, we wanted to include as many surveys as possible to broaden our sample.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-9">9</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Biden’s leads narrowly in several key states</strong></p>
<p>Several polling firms released surveys of Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in April. Former President Barack Obama carried all four states in 2012. Trump flipped all four in 2016 (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/swing-state-margins/">as well as Ohio and Iowa</a>, neither of which has much recent polling.) And Biden appears to lead in all four now. (North Carolina, which has gone Republican in both of the last two cycles, was also polled pretty often in April, with Trump and Biden looking basically tied there.)</p>

</section>
<p>This data highlights a few things. First, at least at the moment, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are very close to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-had-a-superior-electoral-college-strategy/">national tipping point</a> &#8212; so they’re likely to be among the more determinative states this November. Second, the former vice president’s lead nationally is big enough to carry these states. This is important &#8212; if Biden wins all of the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016 <a href="https://www.270towin.com">plus any combination of three of these four</a>, he would be elected president.</p>
<p>But crucially, Biden’s margins in these states are slightly smaller than his advantage in national polls. It’s worth thinking about the race at the state level in these relative terms because there’s still so much time for things to shift. If Biden’s lead nationally narrowed to 2 to 3 percentage points, these states would likely be much closer, if not lean toward Trump. Also, as The New York Times’ Nate Cohn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/upshot/polling-2020-biden-trump.html">wrote recently</a>, Trump is likely to look stronger when pollsters start limiting their results to “likely voters.” Most of the April surveys in these four states were conducted among registered voters or all adults, two groups that include some people who may not vote in November.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="10" href="#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Democrats &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/upshot/2020-election-turnout-analysis.html&quot;&gt;tend to do better&lt;/a&gt; in surveys of adults and registered voters than among likely voters.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-10">10</sup></a></p>
<p>In other words, this data suggests Trump may have an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/upshot/trump-electoral-college-edge-.html">Electoral College advantage again</a> &#8212; he could lose the popular vote and win the election. Of course, this data also suggests that if Biden is winning overall by a margin similar to his advantage now, Trump’s potential Electoral College edge really won’t matter.</p>
<p><b>Biden polling particularly strong in Michigan and Pennsylvania </b></p>
<p>It’s not worth making too much of small differences among states &#8212; we don’t have a lot of polling and things will likely shift between now and November anyway. But it seems pretty clear Biden is doing better in Michigan and Pennsylvania than Florida and Wisconsin. Fox News, Ipsos and Public Policy Polling all recently polled several swing states. All three found Biden had a larger lead in Michigan and Pennsylvania than in other swing states they surveyed (Florida for Fox, North Carolina and Wisconsin for PPP, Wisconsin for Ipsos.)</p>
<p><b>The race is unclear in other Trump 2016 states </b></p>
<p>Outside of the five states I discussed above, a recent poll of Arizona was great for the former vice president, while he wasn’t looking as strong in a survey of Georgia. But I would be very cautious about states in which we only have one or two recent polls. So please keep that caveat in mind, but here are <i>all</i> the states for which we got polls in April &#8212; even the ones with just one poll:</p>

<p>I do think Biden could win Arizona, but that’s based more on Democrats’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-arizona-elections.html">winning a U.S. Senate race there in 2018</a> than the <a href="https://ohpredictive.com/press-releases/bidenextendslead/">recent OH Predictive Insights survey</a> that showed Biden with a 9-point lead in the state.</p>
<p><b>It’s also unclear in Clinton 2016 states</b></p>
<p>It’s likely that Trump and Republicans will target Maine, Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire in particular &#8212; looking for an upset in states Democrats could overlook because they might assume Biden won’t lose where Clinton won four years ago. Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president">narrowly lost in those four states in 2016</a>.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="11" href="#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;He lost Maine by 3.0 points, Minnesota by 1.5 points, Nevada by 2.4 and New Hampshire by 0.4.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-11">11</sup></a> Maine, Minnesota and New Hampshire are states in which a disproportionately high percentage of the electorate is <a href="https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2019/06/26070322/StatesOfChange2019-report1.pdf">non-Hispanic white voters without college degrees</a>, an electoral bloc in which the president was <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/">especially strong in 2016</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/opinion/trump-white-voters.html">could make even more gains in 2020</a>.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="12" href="#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;A 2018 report from demographic experts suggested the American electorate nationally is 42 to 44 percent white non-Hispanic voters. That bloc is estimated to be 63-64 percent of voters in Maine, 55-56 percent of New Hampshire&rsquo;s electorate and 52-54 percent in Minnesota, but only 41-43 percent in Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-12">12</sup></a></p>
<p>But we just need more polling to get a sense for how these states are shaping up relative to the country overall. All we have is one recent poll from any of these four states &#8212; a survey showing the former vice president ahead by 8 points in New Hampshire. Biden’s prospects would be brighter if he ends up outperforming Clinton among non-college whites, making these states less Republican-leaning relative to the country than they were in 2016.</p>
<h2><b>Other polling bites </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Among registered voters in New York, 32 percent said they <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/2020/04/27/coronavirus-pandemic-pushes-cuomo-to-record-high-ratings-voters-trust-cuomo-over-trump-on-ny-reopening-78-16/">personally know someone who has died as a result of the coronavirus</a>, according to a <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SNY0420-Crosstabs.pdf">new Siena College Research Institute poll</a>, compared to 67 percent who said they did not.

<li style="font-weight: 400">About 37 percent of American adults said they had a positive view of capitalism, compared to 41 percent with a neutral view and 21 percent who viewed capitalism negatively, according to <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/4/27/coronavirus-response-tracking-poll-1">a new poll</a> from the <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/about">left-leaning firm Data for Progress</a>. Socialism is less popular, at 18 percent positive, 44 percent neutral, 38 percent negative.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">More than half of American adults said their employment status had been negatively affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/309299/covid-disrupts-americans-jobs-finances.aspx">a recent Gallup poll</a>. The effects included a loss of income (26 percent), hours being reduced (15 percent), being temporarily laid off (10 percent) and losing their job permanently (2 percent). Of the adults who were surveyed who live in households with incomes below $35,000, 68 percent said they had experienced at least one of these four negative effects. Among those in households with incomes over $90,000 per year, 49 percent said they had experienced at least one.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">30 percent of American adults said they thought Trump was kidding when he suggested that scientists study the idea of people injecting disinfectants into their bodies as a way to fight the coronavirus, according to a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/04/27/a699b/2">recent YouGov survey</a>. The majority of Americans (54 percent) did not think Trump was joking. There was a clear partisan split: 68 percent of Republicans said the president was kidding, compared to 16 percent who said he was not and another 16 percent who said they were not sure.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Black adults (28 percent) were more likely than Hispanic (13 percent) or non-Hispanic white (9 percent) adults to say they know someone who has died from COVID-19, according to a <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index-poll-week-7-a4c299b6-307c-4103-8d72-b5cc2b5a37e5.html">recent Axios-Ipsos survey</a>. People in the Northeast (25 percent) were more likely to know someone who has died of the virus than those in the South (12 percent), Midwest (8 percent) or West (7 percent.) Democrats (15 percent) were more likely to know someone who has died than Republicans (8 percent.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">A <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1evYWT-YmsJb5UX84u_l7CgmpY-1T4Hvtiu1R4KO3_oA/edit#gid=0">recent Washington Post/University of Maryland survey</a> found 65 percent of American adults supported temporarily blocking immigration to the U.S. during the COVID-19 outbreak. (Trump recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-immigration-ban.html">enacted a temporary halt to the issuing of green cards</a>, although the pollsters who conducted this survey <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/washington-post-university-of-maryland-national-poll-april-21-26-2020/3583b4e9-66be-4ed6-a457-f6630a550ddf/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2">did not refer to the president’s announcement in their question</a>.) Republicans (83 percent) and independents (67 percent) overwhelmingly favored this idea, while Democrats were split (49 percent supported it, 49 percent opposed it.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Relatively few registered voters (31 percent) said they thought Trump is “honest and trustworthy,” according to a <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/national/2020/4_27_2020_marginals_pdftxt.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=336A52F32EBA7EC16967E96B8CE8FB0311EC454B">new USA Today/Suffolk University poll</a>. But Trump gets higher marks on standing up for American interests (53 percent of voters agreed with this notion), knowing how to get things done (51 percent), being a strong leader (45 percent), working with foreign leaders (45 percent) and caring about “people like me” (39 percent.) Biden was rated the highest by voters on being able to work with foreign leaders (64 percent said they agree with this notion) and was ahead of Trump in three other measures as well. But voters weren’t that confident that Biden is a strong leader (43 percent) or can get things done (48 percent.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">A total of 67 percent of adults said they thought COVID-19 would “significantly disrupt” Americans’s ability to vote in November’s elections, according to a <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/28/two-thirds-of-americans-expect-presidential-election-will-be-disrupted-by-covid-19/">new Pew Research survey</a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="byline secondary">Graphics by <a href="/contributors/anna-wiederkehr/">Anna Wiederkehr</a></p>
<p>This has been a week of important milestones in the coronavirus crisis, but not in a good way. On Tuesday, the number of Americans who have tested positive for COVID-19 passed <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily">1 million</a>, and on Wednesday, deaths attributed to the disease &#8212; which are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html">probably underestimated</a> &#8212; rose to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/29/trump-exit-strategy-coronavirus-223703">more than 60,000</a>.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="13" href="#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;The COVID Tracking Project&rsquo;s national death count was 55,000 on Wednesday, but that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking/status/1255616772981403649?s=20&quot;&gt;does not include 5,300 deaths&lt;/a&gt; reported as probable by New York City but not included in the state&rsquo;s official count.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-13">13</sup></a></p>
<p>As the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths continue to grow, we checked back in with a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/expert-forecasts/">survey of infectious-disease researchers</a> from institutions around the U.S. to help us understand where we might be headed.</p>
<p>For the week ending April 25, 13,788 deaths were attributed to the coronavirus. In <a href="https://works.bepress.com/mcandrew/8/">this week’s survey</a>, which was conducted on April 27 and 28, a plurality of experts predicted that weekly death totals would not fall below 5,000 until after June 20. The experts also forecast that between 1 million and 1.15 million total confirmed cases of COVID-19 will be reported on May 3.</p>
<p>For some questions in the survey — organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts Amherst — respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_forecast">consensus forecasts</a>, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.</p>
<p>Here’s what the experts had to say this week.</p>
<h2>How many confirmed cases will be reported by May 3?</h2>
<p>The experts have been asked this question in the past, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/experts-think-were-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-but-hospitalizations-havent-peaked-yet/">actual case numbers</a> have fallen within their forecasted ranges. This time, they were given a set of five bins of predefined total confirmed cases and were asked to assign a probability to each. For the week ending May 3, the expert consensus is that between 1.1 and 1.15 million total confirmed cases will be reported by <a href="https://covidtracking.com/">The COVID Tracking Project</a>.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-271380" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-2.png" alt="" width="575" height="552" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-2.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-2.png?w=1150 2x" /></p>
<p>As has been true throughout the crisis, however, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the predicted confirmed case count. The consensus forecast says that the chance (about 18 percent) that confirmed cases will be between 1.05 and 1.1 million is the same as the chance it will be above 1.2 million.</p>
<h2>When will new reported deaths per week drop below 5,000?</h2>
<p>In the past two weeks, deaths attributed to the coronavirus have hovered above 13,700 (13,708 and 13,788). A drop to 5,000 weekly deaths would represent a decline of 64 percent &#8212; a substantial decrease. But experts are pessimistic that such a drop will happen in the near future. The expert consensus gives a nearly 40 percent chance of the U.S. hitting the 5,000-death weekly plateau by June 6 and a probability of just over 60 percent of it occurring some time after then.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-271379" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-1.png" alt="" width="575" height="552" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-1.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-1.png?w=1150 2x" /></p>
<h2>What will happen in Georgia?</h2>
<p>On April 23, Georgia partially <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/why-georgia-reopening-coronavirus-pandemic/610882/">reopened for business</a>, and stay-at-home restrictions have continued to be lifted across the state. The seven-day moving average for newly confirmed cases in the Peach State stood at just over 700 per day on April 20. Experts were asked to predict the new daily case average for the week ending on May 16 under the current open regime, along with the daily case average had Georgia not relaxed its stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-271381" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-3.png" alt="" width="575" height="584" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-3.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-3.png?w=1150 2x" /></p>
<p>The consensus forecast of 1,044 new confirmed cases per day in two weeks suggests that Georgia will see a substantial worsening of the virus’s spread as a result of reopening. The daily number of new confirmed cases is forecast to be somewhere between 579 and 2,292, with six experts indicating that an increase to 2,000 or more new cases a day is plausible.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-271382" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-4.png" alt="" width="575" height="606" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-4.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hermsmeyer-EXPERTFORECASTS-3040-4.png?w=1150 2x" /></p>
<p>Experts believe that the spread of COVID-19 could have been reduced had Georgia not relaxed its stay-at-home order. Under this scenario, experts predicted that Georgia would have seen only 487 new cases per day for the week ending on May 16, a reduction of more than 50 percent in new daily cases compared with the estimates in the open regime.</p>
<p>There was also less uncertainty among experts in their predictions for Georgia’s new daily cases in the world where Georgia did not relax stay-at-home orders. Experts would have expected between 273 and 1,156 new cases per day, representing a spread half as large as the one for the new-case forecast without the stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p>As Americans slowly prepare to go back to work, the experts’ forecast helps quantify the increased risk Georgia and other states have incurred by beginning to restart their economies in the midst of a still-uncontrolled pandemic.</p>

<p>Now in its seventh week, the U.S. unemployment crisis continues to deepen. According to Thursday’s <a href="https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf">data release</a> from the Department of Labor, 3.8 million more Americans filed for unemployment insurance during the week ending April 25. Although that represents the fourth consecutive week of decline in seasonally adjusted initial claims, the number remains historic. (Remember, no single week prior to March 21 had ever seen even 1 million initial claims <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA">since 1967</a>, the earliest year that data is available from the Federal Reserve.) If we add up all of the initial claims filed since the coronavirus recession began,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="14" href="#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Though this is still not officially a recession in the most technical definition of the term, this week&rsquo;s report that the U.S. gross domestic product &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/29/gdp-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;had shrunk at a 4.8 percent annualized rate&lt;/a&gt; in the first quarter of 2020 was yet another marker that the recession &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-29/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-4-8-pace-signaling-start-of-recession&quot;&gt;had all but begun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-14">14</sup></a> more than 30 million people &#8212; or nearly 19 percent of the <a href="http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/usadj.htm">total U.S. labor force</a> &#8212; have filed for unemployment claims over the past month and a half.</p>
<p>Experts have all had their eyes trained on initial unemployment claims, both because they tell us about the ongoing scale of the crisis and because they’re one of the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/searchresults/?nasw=0&amp;st=employment&amp;t=weekly&amp;ob=sr&amp;od=desc&amp;types=gen;">rare weekly indicators</a> of the economy at large. Some economists think this weekly trend of massive unemployment numbers includes industries that weren’t hit hard at first but are now beginning to feel the ripple effects of the recession as it spreads through the economy. “Job separations will likely remain high for a while, as softer demand spills over into industries not initially directly affected by shutdowns,&#8221; Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/30/business/30reuters-usa-economy.html">told Reuters</a>. (This is corroborated by sources such as the hiring site Indeed, which has consistently seen <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2020/04/28/coronavirus-and-job-postings-through-april-24/">30 to 40 percent fewer jobs</a> posted than the norm since late March.)</p>
<p>Of course, this week’s data still includes many unemployment claims that overwhelmed state agencies <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/04/29/unemployment-filing-claims-extra-600-states-back-pay-run-out-income-denied-faq/">were not able to process</a> immediately after they were filed. And there are still many workers struggling week by week in industries directly affected by coronavirus shutdowns, such as in restaurants or other parts of the service sector. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/unemployment-filings-hit-6-6-million-doubling-last-weeks-record-high/">Several weeks ago</a>, we pointed to research by St. Louis Fed economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro, who estimated that nearly 50 million jobs were at risk as the country tried to mitigate the virus’s spread. If our current slight downward pattern of initial claims continues each week,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="15" href="#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Each of the past two weeks has seen initial claims totals that were 85 percent of the previous week&rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-15">15</sup></a> we would reach that mark by July.</p>
<p>But will the numbers continue in that same pattern? One of the hallmarks of this crisis is the high number of furloughs &#8212; people who are out of work now (and therefore able to file initial claims) but who could potentially return to their jobs when the economy restarts. A <a href="https://twitter.com/CAPolicyLab/status/1255603116948377601">recent analysis</a> from the California Policy Lab found that 90 percent of that state’s workers who filed for unemployment in early April expected to go back to their previous jobs, a much higher share than the 40 percent who gave that response in February. With many states moving toward <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html">reopening at least some businesses by next week</a>, a large number of those who filed claims earlier in the crisis could potentially be returning to work.</p>
<p>That’s why another important indicator will be what’s called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/continuing-claims.asp">continued claims</a>, or insured unemployment &#8212; the number of people actually receiving unemployment benefits in any given week. (According to the Department of Labor, that number was 17,992,000 for the week ending April 18.) It lags a week behind initial claims, since not all initial claimants are actually eligible to receive payments, but it gives us a faster-moving measure of where the crisis might be headed than the traditional <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE">unemployment rate</a>, which is released each month. The decline of continued claims <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CCSA">tends to go in lockstep</a> with the end of recessions, and it will be important to watch how that metric changes as the restarting economy begins to go through another phase of incredible upheaval over the next month.</p>
<p><a href=""><img alt="&#039;We have a ways to go until data&#039; allows states to reopen: Nate Silver" class="abc-poster-video" width="640" height="360" src="https://s.abcnews.com/images/fivethirtyeight/200426_538_tw_nate_silver_hpMain_16x9_1600.jpg" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The novel coronavirus <a href="http://globalhealth5050.org/covid19/">seems to be killing more men than women</a>.</p>
<p>The trend was first noticed in China, experts say, and the higher COVID-19 death rate for men has since been documented in 33 countries, including Germany, Spain and South Korea. But experts don’t know what’s causing the gap. Is it biological, some quirk of cells and hormones? Is it the result of gendered behaviors that have more to do with sociology than sex chromosomes? Let’s break down what’s going on, because experts say men’s risk level depends on what risks (and which men) you’re talking about.</p>
<h2><b>What we know</b></h2>
<p>While men account for the majority of COVID-19 cases in some countries but a minority of cases in others, they consistently make up the majority of deaths. Out of 35 countries that have reported their COVID deaths in ways that break out victims by sex, 33 had a male-female death ratio greater than 1, meaning men who were confirmed to have the disease were more likely to die than women who were confirmed to have it, according to data compiled by <a href="https://globalhealth5050.org/about-us/">Global Health 50/50</a>, a independent health equity research organization based at University College London. “So far, the mortality disadvantage for men is quite large,” said Jennifer Dowd, a professor of demography and population health at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>This dynamic <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01653/full">isn’t new to medicine</a>. “Women have stronger adaptive immune responses and die less of infectious disease their entire lives, <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/SexGenderInfectDis.pdf">starting from infant mortality</a>,” Dowd said. In general, women’s bodies kick out bacterial and viral invaders faster than men’s do, and vaccines work better for women than for men.</p>
<p>To see why, look to hormones and genetics, said Sabra Klein, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University. Sex hormones appear to play a role determining how well human bodies can fight off disease. In general, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15485092">estrogens amp up the immune system</a>, while androgens (like testosterone) and progesterone suppress it. Hormones have to interact with cells to do their jobs, Klein said, so cells have a “lock” and hormones have the “key” to get in. And, turns out, every immune cell in your body has these kinds of lock-and-key receptors.</p>
<p>Sex chromosomes also play a role. The X chromosome, for example, has 60 genes associated with immune function. Most biological males are born with one X chromosome, but those immune-boosting genes tend to be expressed more frequently in women, who generally have two X chromosomes, Klein said.</p>
<p>But if you’re tempted to think those sex differences boil down to “men are more likely to die from infectious disease,” Klein cautioned that the generalization is not true across the board. Sex differentiation in influenza has been pretty well studied, she told me, and, in that case, women’s more aggressive immune systems don’t give us an advantage. Having too much of an inflammatory immune response to the flu can actually increase your risk of complications &#8212; including acute respiratory distress syndrome, when the lungs’ tiny air sacs, called alveoli, are damaged and fill with fluid. “Reproductive-age women do worse, not better,” Klein said.</p>
<h2><b>What we know we don’t know</b></h2>
<p>But while researchers know a decent amount about sex differences in influenza, the novel coronavirus is, yes, novel. Any research on it is a work in progress, proceeding without full data. That starts with basic documentation.</p>
<p>On April 28th, the United States had reported <a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/">57,318</a> deaths from the novel coronavirus, but only 31,586 of those deaths had been reported in ways that allowed Global Health 50/50 to break them down by sex. None of the researchers I spoke with knew <i>why</i> that data isn’t getting reported. But without it, they’re left to a lot of guesswork and speculation. It’s safe to assume that deaths in the U.S. are probably following the patterns seen in many other countries &#8212; but we don’t know for sure that that’s true.</p>
<p>Then there’s the fact that the variations in how this virus affects people probably isn’t just about what’s in their chromosomes or hormones. It’s also about sociological gender &#8212; the attitudes, stereotypes and norms that shape the ways people behave and the choices they make.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5074573/">a 2016 meta-analysis</a> showed that women are about 50 percent more likely than men to start using non-pharmaceutical protective behaviors during a pandemic &#8212; things like wearing face masks or avoiding public transit. Men, meanwhile, were about 12 percent more likely than women to sign up for vaccines, take antiviral medication, or use other pharmaceutical interventions. Those differences in behavior aren’t determined by biology, but they could help create variations in how a virus affects men and women.</p>
<p>Rosemary Morgan, a scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies how gender and sex interact with public health, thinks these kinds of effects are happening with COVID-19. But how and to what extent &#8212; that’s unknown. It also probably differs from country to country, thanks to the way gender norms also aren’t consistent everywhere you go.</p>
<p>Case in point: When data on sex disparities in COVID-19 deaths first began to come in from China, it wasn’t clear that the differences in death rates there would mean other counties were going to experience the same thing. That’s because China has particularly gendered smoking habits, Dowd told me. In a 2010 study, <a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/71/2/154">54 percent of Chinese men surveyed were current smokers</a>. In contrast, the same study found that less than 3 percent of Chinese women currently smoked. Although sex differences in COVID-19 death rates have cropped up again in other countries, it’s likely that this gender disparity in smoking plays a role in why 64 percent of China’s COVID-19 deaths have been among men even though men account for right around half of China’s confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Gender norms may also influence the niches where women are getting the disease more than men, despite men’s higher death rates. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at the characteristics of health care workers who have contracted COVID-19, it found that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e6.htm?s_cid=mm6915e6_x">73 percent were women</a>. Why are female health care workers getting infected at much higher rates? Part of it likely has to do with their higher odds of exposure.</p>
<p>Nurses’ jobs put them in close physical contact with patients who <a href="https://autonomy.work/portfolio/jari/">have COVID-19 and other infectious diseases</a>, and more than 70 percent of nurses are women. Meanwhile, the personal protective equipment meant to help keep medical workers safe often <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/sexism-on-the-covid-19-frontline-ppe-is-made-for-a-6ft-3in-rugby-player">isn’t designed with women in mind</a>. Gloves can be too large. Masks don’t always fit women’s faces with a tight seal. Gender dynamics could be putting a largely female workforce in harm’s way.</p>
<p>In the end, regardless of your sex &#8212; or your gender &#8212; the risks you face from COVID-19 are probably somewhat unique to you. But if we want to figure out just what, exactly, those risks are, we’re going to need more data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time since 1945, <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/28981311/wimbledon-cancelled-due-coronavirus-pandemic">there will be no Wimbledon</a> this year. And there’s no guarantee that the coronavirus pandemic won’t yet cancel the U.S. Open, <a href="https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2020-04-13/frequently_asked_questions_2020_us_open.html">scheduled to start in late August</a>, and the French Open, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/sports/tennis/french-open-postponed.html">postponed from May to September</a>. If the rest of the 2020 tennis season is abandoned altogether, the title runs of two of the most dominant players in the history of the sport could be all but over.</p>
<p>Roger Federer and Serena Williams, both 38 years old, were already mired in small title slumps going into this season. Federer <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/roger-federer/f324/titles-and-finals">last won a Slam</a> at the 2018 Australian Open, while Williams <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/players/230234/serena-williams/grand-slams">last won one in 2017</a>, also in Melbourne. Williams, of course, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/04/26/serena-williams-says-she-was-nervous-to-play-in-australian-open-while-pregnant/">was pregnant at the time</a>; she then took a year off from the sport before returning to the majors at the <a href="https://www.rolandgarros.com/en-us/article/serena-wins-on-grand-slam-return-roland-garros-2018">2018 French Open</a>.</p>
<p>There had been signs, though, that both Williams and Federer might claim at least one more singles major. Williams made the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-eyes-are-on-serena-williams-in-australia/">in both 2018 and 2019</a>, and she <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tennis-keeps-producing-challengers-to-serenas-throne-she-keeps-beating-them/">looked dominant at times</a> during those runs. Federer nearly won his <a href="http://www.espn.com/tennis/history">ninth Wimbledon</a> last July against Novak Djokovic: He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnLdAeSXZv0">needed one point at 40-15</a>, on his serve, to take the title, but Djokovic came back to defeat him.</p>
<p>Wimbledon’s cancellation on its own was tough for the chances of both Federer and Williams to win again. Federer has won Wimbledon in 38 percent of his <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/roger-federer/f324/player-activity?year=all&amp;tournament=540">21 appearances</a>,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="16" href="#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;He has never missed that tournament while on the Tour.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-16">16</sup></a> while Williams has won seven of the 19 tourneys she’s played at the All England Club. Both were likely to have <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/us/tennis/wimbledon-womens">been among</a> the <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/us/tennis/wimbledon-mens">Wimbledon favorites</a> this year.</p>
<p>The two tennis legends were already <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tennis-is-growing-old-with-federer-nadal-and-the-williams-sisters/">fighting a race against time</a>. Only seven majors in the Open era<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="17" href="#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis#Open_Era&quot;&gt;Since 1968&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-17">17</sup></a> have been won by players at age 35 or older, including Federer’s three most recent and Williams’s one. If the last two majors of the season are also canceled but next season starts as normal, both players will go into the 2021 Australian Open as 39-year-olds &#8212; older than any player to have previously won a major.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-271299 aligncenter" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/perrotta-TENNIS-0429.png" alt="" width="575" height="888" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/perrotta-TENNIS-0429.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/perrotta-TENNIS-0429.png?w=1150 2x" /></p>
<p>Williams has 23 Grand Slam singles titles, just <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/serena-williams-will-need-to-serve-better-to-tie-margaret-court/">one behind the 24</a> of all-time leader Margaret Court &#8212; though Court’s titles started before the Open era. Without this year’s tournaments, Williams <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/what-does-wimbledons-cancellation-mean-for-serenas-grand-slam-record-chase/">may not get another good shot</a> to tie Court. But unlike in men&#8217;s tennis, no current female player is within shouting distance of Williams’s total: The next closest active player in number of major titles is Serena’s sister, Venus Williams, who <a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/players/230220/venus-williams/grand-slams">owns a mere seven</a> &#8212; tied for <a href="https://www.totalsportek.com/tennis/grand-slam-titles-winners-mens-women/">12th all-time</a> and eighth in the Open era &#8212; and will turn 40 in June. No other active woman has more than the four of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/sports/tennis/kim-clijsters-comeback.html">Kim Clijsters</a>, who has just come out of retirement at age 36.</p>
<p>On the men’s side, however, Federer faces serious challengers to his record of 20 Slams. Rafael Nadal, with 19 titles, and Novak Djokovic, with 17, are hot on his heels &#8212; with time on their side. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/djokovic-keeps-the-big-three-dominance-alive/">Djokovic won the Australian Open</a> earlier this year at <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/novak-djokovic/d643/overview">age 32</a> and has taken five of the past seven majors. And Nadal, <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/rafael-nadal/n409/overview">still just 33</a>, has won <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/26935020/ranking-rafael-nadal-12-french-open-titles">12 of the 15 French Opens</a> he has entered, including the past three, and he’s taken <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/rafael-nadal/n409/titles-and-finals">two of the past three U.S. Open titles</a>. Given their form over the past two seasons, both appear likely to eclipse Federer’s record, but they would have a narrower window without this year’s tournaments. And even if the remaining two majors are played, the timing may be problematic, especially for Nadal: The French Open is set to start just a week after the final of the U.S. Open, so players who will have competed in New York will have very little time to prepare for the clay of Roland-Garros.</p>
<p>Cancellation of the season wouldn’t make things any easier for the men outside the Big Three, either. Andy Murray, <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/andy-murray/mc10/overview">who turns 33</a> in May, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/sports/andy-murray-retire.html">flirted with retirement</a> last year after a hip injury before <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2849076-andy-murray-announces-return-to-singles-competition-after-hip-injury">returning to the court</a>, but a pelvic injury then <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/51142442">kept him out of this year’s Australian Open</a>. Would he wait until 2021 to try another return? Stan Wawrinka, 35, has <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/stan-wawrinka/w367/overview">won three Slam titles</a> but has been in a dry spell since winning the U.S. Open in 2016. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-officially-zero-mens-grand-slam-winners-in-their-20s/">No man born after Marin Čilić</a> has ever won a major, but the 31-year-old hasn’t made even a Slam semifinal since losing to Federer in the 2018 Australian Open final.</p>
<p>For the younger generation of players, these cancellations may simply present another obstacle to their efforts to break through. Of the men <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/rankings/singles">ranked in the ATP top 10</a> not named Federer, Nadal or Djokovic, Dominic Thiem has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dominic-thiem-doesnt-play-as-much-anymore-and-thats-a-good-thing/">come the closest</a> to winning a Slam: The <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/dominic-thiem/tb69/titles-and-finals">26-year-old</a> made the last two French Open finals and the Australian Open finals this year. Daniil Medvedev, 24, is the only other top 10 player with <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/daniil-medvedev/mm58/titles-and-finals">a major final</a> to his name.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="18" href="#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Last year&rsquo;s U.S. Open.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-18">18</sup></a> Someone other than the Big Three will win a major eventually, but he might not be among this group if too many opportunities are lost.</p>
<p>It’s still too early to tell whether the remaining majors this year will go on as planned. When tennis returns, Federer and Williams will continue to fight the tennis aging curve. The owners of two of the greatest collections of major title trophies in history will still be on the hunt for more &#8212; but with at least one fewer tournament at their disposal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the presidential primary essentially settled, talk has already turned to who will be former Vice President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-time-for-another-2020-vice-presidential-draft/">running mate</a>. But if history is any guide, we won’t know the answer for a few months.</p>
<p>In the modern era of presidential nominations, which began when a number of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-selectionprocess-factbox/how-selecting-u-s-presidential-candidates-became-the-peoples-choice-idUSKCN0WW001">primary reforms were implemented in 1972</a>, the presumptive presidential nominee has never announced his or her vice presidential pick before July 6. And we could be waiting much longer than that: A few running mates haven’t been announced until late <i>August</i>.</p>

<p>But that wide date range obscures the fact that vice presidential candidate announcements are closely tied to the timing of the party conventions — which, of course, varies every election year. Four of the vice presidential nominees since 1972 were announced <i>at</i> the convention, and almost all the others were announced shortly before.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="19" href="#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;George McGovern&rsquo;s choice of Sargent Shriver in 1972 was a weird one; McGovern originally named Thomas Eagleton as his running mate at the convention, but Eagleton &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2012/08/04/157670201/the-thomas-eagleton-affair-haunts-candidates-today&quot;&gt;dropped off the ticket&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks later after it was revealed that he had been hospitalized for depression and had received electroshock treatment. McGovern &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/shriver-happy-and-very-proud-to-be-on-the-mcgovern-ticket.html&quot;&gt;announced Shriver as Eagleton&rsquo;s replacement&lt;/a&gt; 23 days after the convention ended.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-19">19</sup></a></p>
<p>For most of American history, vice presidential nominees were chosen during the conventions themselves, originally by the same chaotic, multiple-ballot process that was used to pick presidential nominees, but eventually at the direction of the presidential nominee, a trend that started with <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2016/07/how-running-mates-used-be-picked-and-when-they-were-announced/">Franklin D. Roosevelt choosing Henry Wallace in 1940</a>. And in 1984, Walter Mondale became the first presidential candidate to announce his running mate before the convention began (his pick, Geraldine Ferraro, also made history in another, more important way — she was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/13/us/geraldine-ferraro-chosen-mondale-running-mate-first-women-major-ticket.html">first woman on a major-party presidential ticket</a>).</p>
<p>Since then, the No. 2 spot on the ticket has almost always been announced the week before the convention, with the median vice presidential announcement occurring four days before the convention gavels in. However, there have been some exceptions to this pattern. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/07/06/kerry.vp/">John Kerry revealed John Edwards</a> as his choice on July 6, 2004 — 20 days before the Democratic convention — and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/mitt-romney-selects-paul-ryan-running-mate/story?id=16983499">Mitt Romney unveiled Paul Ryan</a> on Aug. 11, 2012 — 16 days before the Republican conference.</p>
<p>This (plus failed presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz’s stunt of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/04/27/475923611/ted-cruz-chooses-carly-fiorina-as-vice-presidential-pick">choosing businesswoman Carly Fiorina in 2016</a><a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="20" href="#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Fiorina is not included in the data above, for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-20">20</sup></a>) <i>could</i> suggest it’s becoming more common for candidates to announce their running mates weeks in advance. However, Cruz’s selection was seen as a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-cruz-fiorina-stunt-20160428-story.html">desperate ploy</a> to resurrect his sinking presidential campaign, and Romney’s was seen as an attempt to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/the-ticket/paul-ryan-help-mitt-romney-change-conversation-081857178.html">change the narrative</a> amid a bad news cycle, so we should probably still only expect early announcements in limited circumstances. (And considering that Biden is leading Trump in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/">most early polls</a>, he does not fit the historical mold of a candidate who needs to announce his choice early.)</p>
<p>At one point, we probably could have expected Biden’s announcement in early July, shortly before the Democratic National Convention kicked off on July 13. But the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/milwaukee-democratic-convention-delayed.html">coronavirus-related delay of the convention</a> to the week of Aug. 17 probably also pushed back the timing of the veep pick. If Biden follows the pattern of past nominees, we can probably expect to learn the identity of his running mate the week of Aug. 10. And if you’re trying to plan when exactly to <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/boston-janesville-robert-costa/">track airplanes</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/betsy_klein/status/756514211233140736?s=20">monitor finalists’ every move</a>, might I recommend Friday, Aug. 14? The last five vice presidential picks have all been announced either the Friday before the convention or early that Saturday morning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coronavirus pandemic has raised a host of new questions about the 2020 election. What will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-states-with-lockdown-protests-been-hit-harder-by-unemployment/">the economy look like in November</a>? How do voters think President Trump is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/?ex_cid=rrpromo">handling the crisis</a>? How will <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-coronavirus-could-change-how-we-vote-in-2020-and-beyond/">Americans physically cast their votes</a>? And could the current moment be so extraordinary that it outweighs partisanship and causes Republican voters to abandon Trump in November?</p>
<p>For the last question, at least, we can look to history for some clues. The 2008 election isn’t exactly parallel to our current situation, but there were some similarities. Back then, an unpopular Republican president, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/">George W. Bush</a>, sat in the White House <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/2008-financial-crisis-3305679">amid an economic disaster</a>, though he wasn’t running for reelection. But the environment that GOP nominee Sen. John McCain was running in may be not unlike the one Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/us/politics/trump-election-briefings.html">faces in 2020</a>. (One important caveat: When McCain ran, the GOP had already held the presidency for two terms, and historically, it’s rare for the same party to <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/historic-re-election-pattern-doesnt-favor-democrats-in-2016">win three times in a row</a>. Conversely, it’s <a href="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcampbel/documents/Elect2012ForumFinal_001.pdf">very common</a> for incumbent presidents like Trump to win a second term.)</p>
<p>The 2008 election resulted in a Democratic landslide, as then-Sen. Barack Obama defeated McCain by about 7 percentage points in the national popular vote. Considering how polarized our politics are, this was a large victory <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-blowout-presidential-elections-a-thing-of-the-past/">by modern standards</a>, as the chart below shows.</p>
<figure id="attachment_271270" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-271270" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Skelley-McCain-Trump-0429-copy.png" alt="" width="575" height="670" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Skelley-McCain-Trump-0429-copy.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Skelley-McCain-Trump-0429-copy.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>Democrats didn’t just take the White House either. They also made huge gains in the Senate and House of Representatives, adding to their majorities in both chambers.</p>
<p>But Democrats didn’t win because Republicans were fleeing the party or voting for the Democrat en masse &#8212; McCain still won support from most Republicans who turned out that year. The 2008 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a massive survey that asks Americans about their politics and voting habits, found that McCain won 95 percent of self-identified Republicans who voted, as well as 90 percent of independents who leaned Republican. Similarly, Obama won the overwhelming majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (92 and 93 percent).<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="21" href="#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;The 2008 CCES figures are based on validated voters. Because Virginia voters could not be validated at the time, that state was excluded from this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-21">21</sup></a> This partisan split <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/independent-voters-partisans-in-the-closet-101931">is in line with results</a> from other recent presidential elections, too.</p>
<p>The difference in 2008 was the makeup of the electorate: 51 percent of voters identified as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents while 41 percent identified as Republicans or Republican-leaning, according to CCES data.</p>
<p>Some of this was because <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-5705.2010.03757.x">Democratic identification</a> more or less <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/274694/party-preferences-steady-during-trump-era.aspx">peaked in 2008</a> while Republican identification was at a low point. Democrats also saw strong turnout from Democratic-leaning demographic groups like African Americans, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/us/politics/21vote.html">showed up in historic numbers to vote for America’s first black president</a>. And getting those partisans to the ballot box was vital to Obama’s victory, as he actually lost among “pure” independents, or those who didn’t lean toward either party, by 11 percentage points. Fortunately, for Obama, true independents only made up about 7 percent of the total electorate.</p>
<p>Of course, we don’t know how many votes McCain might have lost because people abandoned the GOP <i>before</i> the election or because some Republicans simply didn’t show up to vote. Corwin Smidt, a political scientist at Michigan State University, told me that it’s likely that some people switched parties because of the financial crisis or the Iraq War, but he said it was probably a fairly small share of the electorate. One study estimated that Obama may have <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8344/49e630769429e703cdae58feeda44fcbdb94.pdf">won 15 percent of voters</a> who said they backed George W. Bush in 2004.</p>
<p>Smidt told me he thought we could see some people switch parties here in 2020, though, with some Republicans leaving the party because of the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus. In fact, there is some evidence that a small share of voters have already shifted parties during the Trump presidency. In 2017, the <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2017/05/17/partisan-identification-is-sticky-but-about-10-switched-parties-over-the-past-year/">Pew Research Center found</a> that roughly one-tenth of Democrats and Republicans (including those who leaned toward one party) defected to the other party over the course of the 2016 campaign and in the early days of Trump’s presidency. But Smidt cautioned that we’re still likely only talking about a small slice of the electorate who might switch parties in 2020 <a href="https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2019/6/21/18679314/trump-support-is-not-normal-partisanship">because Trump is so polarizing</a> and <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2019/10/10/the-partisan-landscape-and-views-of-the-parties/">there is such a gulf between Democrats and Republicans</a> on most political issues. “If party differences are clear, people are less likely to switch,” said Smidt. And right now, he says, “It is hard for people to switch.”</p>
<p>Studies have shown that partisans are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12218">more likely to stick with their party</a> now than they were just a few years ago, and people <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2019/10/10/partisan-antipathy-more-intense-more-personal/">feel more negatively than ever</a> toward members of the other party. Surveys also suggest that the overall share of people who identify with or lean toward each party <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/274694/party-preferences-steady-during-trump-era.aspx">has been relatively stable</a>. So that means Trump’s intraparty support may be just as strong as McCain’s was in 2008. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-economy-still-the-most-important-thing-for-trumps-reelection/">His approval rating has been remarkably steady</a>, and he’s enjoyed very strong Republican backing throughout his presidency, with as many as 91 percent of Republicans and 89 percent of Republican leaners approving of his job performance before the 2018 midterm elections, according to CCES data for registered voters.</p>
<p>There’s little sign that Republicans are backing away from Trump either. A <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/03/26/views-of-how-officials-public-have-responded-to-covid-19/">late March poll from Pew</a> found that, among registered voters,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="22" href="#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Based on self-reported registration status.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-22">22</sup></a> 92 percent of Republicans approved of Trump, as did 79 percent of independents who leaned Republican. While the approval among leaners may seem low compared to the 2018 CCES data, it was actually similar to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/01/trumps-approval-ratings-so-far-are-unusually-stable-and-deeply-partisan/">previous Pew polls</a> that found 70 to 75 percent of Republican leaners approved of Trump.</p>
<p>So just like McCain in 2008, Trump likely still has very strong backing from Republicans that will almost certainly hold up even if things go poorly for him in the coming months. What we can’t know, of course, is just how much a bad economy might move people away from the GOP before the election, or how many partisans might simply stay home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/">weekly politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>
<div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div>

<p><b>sarahf </b>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): You may have thought that with former Vice President Joe Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee our 2020 drafts were finally over. Well, no such luck. There’s still the question of whom Biden will pick as his vice president. We know thanks to his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/15/politics/joe-biden-woman-vice-president/index.html">announcement at an earlier presidential debate</a> that he plans to pick a female running mate, but that’s it.</p>
<p>So we’re back with a <a href="http://www.playdailyfantasysports.com/what-is-a-snake-draft/">snake draft</a> of whom Biden should pick for his VP. How it works is simple: Three rounds total, so between the three of us, nine potential 2020 Democratic veeps. And the draft line up is …</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Nathaniel</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Sarah</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Geoffrey</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, you’re up, Nathaniel.</p>
<p><b>nrakich </b>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, elections analyst): Ahhh, I wanted the second pick.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley </b>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/geoffrey-skelley/">Geoffrey Skelley</a>, elections analyst)<b>: </b>Hahaha, really?</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah — I think there are two equally strong contenders for the first overall pick. But I will go for the more obvious one: Sen. Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Harris obviously ran for president already, which means she&#8217;s been vetted. She has also long been considered a rising star in the party. Plus, she would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/joe-biden-vice-president-black-candidates.html">make history</a> as both the first African American and first Asian American vice president, and African American voters are probably a group that Biden should reach out to given that he won the nomination <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/joe-biden-owes-it-all-to-african-american-voters.html">thanks largely to their support</a>. And this goes without saying, but Democrats will want to try to get African American turnout in the general election closer to where it was for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/12/4-4-million-2012-obama-voters-stayed-home-in-2016-more-than-a-third-of-them-black/">former President Barack Obama</a> than where it was for Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>There will inevitably be some &#8220;ooh, remember how they <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/27/harris-attacks-bidens-record-on-busing-and-working-with-segregationists.html">attacked each other in that first primary debate</a>&#8221; chatter, but I think that moment is overblown. Harris was doing what she had to do to win. And both before and after that incident, Biden and Harris have reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-endorsement.html">gotten along quite well</a>.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Some say the first rule of vice presidential selection is to &#8220;do no harm,&#8221; and Harris would probably fit that bill on a number of fronts. She&#8217;s been in the spotlight and vetted as a former presidential candidate, as Nathaniel said. In other words, she&#8217;d meet the &#8220;Ready on Day 1&#8221; test that I think is pretty key for Biden.</p>
<p>Additionally, California isn’t a swing state, but Harris’s Senate seat would likely remain in Democratic hands. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom would appoint her replacement and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/Class_III.htm">when her seat is up in 2022</a>, Democrats would be very likely to hold onto it.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, I think the <a href="http://baseballot.blogspot.com/2012/07/politically-veepstakes-isnt-worth.html">home-state effect of vice-presidential candidates</a> is slim to none. That&#8217;s going to inform a lot of my picks.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>In their <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/28/biden-vice-president-2020-elections-212555">veepstakes feature</a> on Tuesday, Politico set up Biden&#8217;s VP decision as a choice between appealing to black voters and appealing to the progressive wing of the party. So if he were to select Harris &#8212; whom I agree does seem like a very solid pick for him &#8212; I guess that only checks one of those boxes. But arguably, it’s not really possible for Biden to check both boxes with one VP.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>I think the Biden campaign would argue Harris gives them some of both &#8212; she is a cosponsor on Sen. Bernie Sanders&#8217;s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1129/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded&amp;KWICView=false">Medicare for All legislation,</a> for instance.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>That’s true, but I still think about how she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/upshot/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all-debate.html">infamously raised her hand</a> in one of the early debates to say she supported Medicare for All, only to walk that back later.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, one downside to Harris is that the progressive wing of the party doesn&#8217;t really trust her. (Think of the &#8220;<a href="https://theslot.jezebel.com/did-the-kamala-is-a-cop-meme-help-tank-harriss-campaign-1840056843">Kamala is a cop</a>&#8221; meme.) But I agree, it&#8217;s hard to appeal to both, and I think African Americans are the more important constituency for Biden.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>Well, and to the point you raised initially, Nathaniel, Biden won the nomination thanks in large part to black Democrats&#8217; support &#8212; think South Carolina in particular &#8212; so it&#8217;s hard to not think that is a major consideration for Biden when weighing options.</p>
<p>But OK, I&#8217;m up. Ugh. At least I don&#8217;t have to go last in this draft.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Sigh.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>So I&#8217;m not totally sure I agree with my own pick, but if part of the optics around Biden&#8217;s VP pick requires appealing to black voters or progressive voters, I wonder if he can&#8217;t try and do both by picking Rep. Ayanna Pressley.</p>
<p>I know Sen. Elizabeth Warren would be a more natural, high-profile pick to represent the progressive wing of the party, especially considering she ran for president, and Pressley is only a one-term House representative, but I’d argue Pressley, like fellow Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, represents <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-squad-v-pelosi-be-a-big-problem-for-democrats-in-2020/">a new direction for the party</a>, which I think is an important characteristic for Biden&#8217;s VP to have.</p>
<p>I suppose that Pressley’s lack of experience is what hurts her chances to be Biden’s running mate the most. Massachusetts isn&#8217;t exactly a swing state either.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Bold pick! Although I have learned the hard way <a href="https://twitter.com/mayasweedler/status/1166827013711249408?s=20">not to bet against Sarah</a> in these drafts&#8230;</p>
<p>I think Pressley is an interesting choice, but ultimately, I think the lack of experience dooms her. Biden, at 77, is the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-if-a-presidential-nominee-can-no-longer-run-for-office/">oldest major-party presidential nominee ever</a>. That means the top consideration for the Biden campaign should be picking someone who will be ready to become president on day one.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Yeah, Pressley is fascinating, and it&#8217;s no coincidence that her name popped up in discussions about <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/darrensands/massachusetts-democrats-kennedy-ayanna-pressley-markey">what might happen to Warren&#8217;s Senate seat</a> if Warren had won the nomination (or maybe the vice presidency, still). But I agree with Nathaniel that Biden is unlikely to pick a one-term House member.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a rising star, but maybe the 2020 election is just too near.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>The lack of experience definitely cuts against Pressley. But if Biden’s top VP considerations are appealing to black and progressive voters, I think it’s impressive she can check both boxes. I also thought she was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/ayanna-pressley-endorses-elizabeth-warren.html">pretty effective endorser of Warren</a> in the primary, but yeah, I admit that I’m not convinced this will actually happen.</p>
<p>OK, you&#8217;re up Geoffrey!!</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Alright, I think my first pick is a bit predictable, but she would obviously fit in nicely with Biden&#8217;s political outlook: Sen. Amy Klobuchar.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Oh, bad pick.</p>
<p>Maybe my alternative first choice will still be on the board after all&#8230;</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>She ran for president and has a long history of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/amy-klobuchar-2020-democratic-nomination-kickoff/">doing well in a purple state</a>. Plus, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/02/klobuchar-to-drop-out-of-2020-campaign-endorse-biden-118823">she endorsed Biden</a> right after dropping out of the Democratic presidential primary, so that may have also nicely positioned her for consideration.</p>
<p>And again, if the idea is to do no harm, she&#8217;s a fairly safe choice. But whereas I can see some progressives coming around to Harris, it&#8217;s harder to see that happening with Klobuchar.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think that after Harris, she&#8217;s probably the second-most-likely senator to get picked.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>That&#8217;s true, Geoffrey, I don’t see progressives warming up to Klobuchar like they might with Harris. In some ways, picking Klobuchar would be Biden doubling down on his base &#8212; i.e., appealing to more moderate voters, right?</p>
<p>Why do you say, bad pick, Nathaniel?</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I just don&#8217;t see what Klobuchar adds. She is incredibly redundant with Biden in terms of ideology and appeal to swing voters. Biden should try to pick someone who appeals to a different constituency.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>There&#8217;s a chance Biden will view that redundancy as a good thing, though.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I’m also not sure that Klobuchar wouldn&#8217;t do any harm &#8230; While I could see the left grumbling about, but ultimately accepting, Harris, I think they would be much more actively opposed to Klobuchar, who was always toward the center of the Democratic presidential field.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>That’s fair, but at the same time, I suspect Klobuchar wouldn&#8217;t turn off some of the voters in the middle the way Harris might.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Also, it’s not necessarily a dealbreaker in the same way it would be for some other potential VP picks (cough Tammy Baldwin cough), but if Klobuchar resigns from the Senate, her seat would go to a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vacancies-in-the-united-states-senate.aspx">special election in November 2022</a>, two years ahead of schedule, putting a Senate seat unnecessarily in danger.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>But that&#8217;s a concern with almost every senator outside of Harris!</p>
<p>Democrats have a fairly deep bench in Minnesota, too, so that might not be that risky of a move.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Hm, I disagree there. Other senators are on different schedules or hail from bluer states than Minnesota.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Out of the people likely to get picked, though?</p>
<p>Maybe Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Shhh, spoilers!</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Lol, the Senate special election discussion could take up half the chat.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Was that not the plan??</p>
<p>In all seriousness, though, it&#8217;s a <i>very</i> important factor in the veepstakes discussion. A President Biden would need every Democratic vote in the Senate he can muster to pass his agenda.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>That’s a good point, but OK &#8212; you&#8217;re up again, Geoffrey.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>My next pick is Sen. Tammy Duckworth. The Illinois senator flies a little under the radar, but she&#8217;s got <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/tammy-duckworth-interview-vogue-october-2018-issue">a fascinating background</a> as an Asian American veteran who lost both her legs as a helicopter pilot fighting in Iraq. She&#8217;s also from a blue state, so her seat would be more likely to remain in Democratic hands (it&#8217;s up in 2022).</p>
<p>However, as 2010 showed, weird things can happen &#8212; the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/us/politics/03illinois.html">GOP captured this very same seat</a> that year, formerly held by Obama, so it&#8217;s worth noting that Illinois isn&#8217;t California.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Ah, dammit. Duckworth was my second choice. She would be a great pick, for all the reasons Geoffrey says.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>She also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/tammy-duckworth-birth.html">gave birth while in office</a>, the first senator to do so!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just a lot to her story that I could see winning the Biden campaign over.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, she has a great story to tell, on many different dimensions.</p>
<p>And her low national name recognition right now could be seen as a reason not to pick her, but it&#8217;s also an opportunity.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>Right, I mean it&#8217;s not like Sen. Tim Kaine had a huge national profile prior to when Clinton picked him in 2016.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, I think people generally overrate people who ran for president and lost when thinking about veep contenders.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Yeah, honestly the main reason I picked Klobuchar ahead of Duckworth was Klobuchar ran for president and has more of a national profile. But Duckworth might be the better pick &#8212; it&#8217;s less clear that she would offend any part of the Democratic coalition.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>OK, let&#8217;s see. It undercuts my first pick (Pressley), but I also think Warren would be interesting. Clearly, I have a Massachusetts bias.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Massachusetts bias is nothing to be ashamed of, Sarah.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>But assuming national profile matters somewhat in who a candidate picks for VP (to be clear, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-biden-choose-a-running-mate-based-on-electability-ideology-or-identity/">political science</a> on this isn&#8217;t really clear, but it does seem to matter to party elites), Warren has got that covered. And apparently, when Biden was still considering running in 2016, he wanted <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-223104">Warren as his running mate</a>! That&#8217;s interesting to me, considering the visible bad blood between the two during the debates (thinking about their heated exchange over <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-democratic-presidential-debate">who deserves credit for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>).</p>
<p>What Warren would bring to the ticket is an ideological balance that I think few other candidates could give Biden, but I could also see her being a potential general election risk for Biden. I&#8217;m also not sure if the other constituency she appeals to &#8212; college-educated whites &#8212; is where Biden needs the most help?</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Warren would certainly meet the Ready on Day 1 test, plus she&#8217;d unify the party pretty well. I do wonder if she&#8217;s a case where the Biden campaign might be concerned that the VP pick outshines the presidential nominee. That’s on top of the concerns that her progressive views might alienate some in the middle.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, Warren was also pretty high on my board. If you decide your goal is to appeal to progressives, there&#8217;s no better choice (other than, I guess, Sen. Bernie Sanders, although that isn&#8217;t going to happen for many reasons). She has the experience to be president and demonstrated that she has a loyal following with her strong presidential campaign.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>That’s true, but there is still the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/youll-never-know-which-candidate-is-electable/">always-thorny electability question</a> about whether Warren’s progressive positions would harm Biden&#8217;s attempts to have a broader appeal.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, I wonder how that would play, Geoffrey. In this age of polarization, it&#8217;s debatable whether a presidential nominee on the ideological extremes <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330565898_Man_Bites_Blue_Dog_Are_Moderates_Really_More_Electable_than_Ideologues">still puts the ticket at a disadvantage</a>; would a vice-presidential nominee on the extremes do the same thing? I&#8217;m not so sure.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>I will say that a Warren pick would be interesting in that, at 71 years old by Election Day, Warren would be less likely to end up running for president should Biden win, so the VP pick wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be a launch pad for the next presidential contender.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Eh, I don&#8217;t know, she could probably run in 2024 if she wanted. (I think there&#8217;s a strong possibility that Biden would not run for a second term.)</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>That&#8217;s true, but with most of these other names, the VP would very likely run in the future if the ticket won &#8212; or even if it didn’t. But we’re probably getting a little ahead of ourselves here.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>OK, Nathaniel, you&#8217;re up with your second and third picks!</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>OK, next on my list is Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. She has risen quickly in the Senate ranks; though she was just elected in 2016, she has already become chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. (I guess you could ding her for being inexperienced, but she was also state attorney general for two terms before that — in other words, she&#8217;s as experienced as Harris.) And, as a Latina, she would bring some racial diversity to the ticket, although I don’t want to imply that means she will automatically boost the ticket with Latino voters. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-sanders-may-start-losing-more-latino-voters-to-biden/">Latinos are not a uniform group</a>, and picking a Mexican American woman from the West wouldn’t necessarily resonate with, say, Cuban American voters in Florida.</p>
<p>(And, for you Senate special-election nerds, Cortez Masto&#8217;s seat will be up for election in 2022 regardless, so the only difference will be whether it is an open seat or not.)</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Definitely a good pick. She&#8217;s under the radar, sort of like Duckworth, but has a very strong resume and a history-making backstory.</p>
<p>But with the Senate stuff, you wonder if the Biden team&#8217;s mindset is, &#8216;Look, we&#8217;ll probably lose the Senate in 2022 even if <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-checking-in-on-all-those-2020-senate-races-a-few-gop-incumbents-look-vulnerable/">Democrats overcome a tough map</a> to narrowly gain control of it in 2020, so we should make the best pick regardless of what that means for the Senate.&#8217;</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, maybe. But there is definitely a downside to picking someone like Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who I suspect will go unchosen in this draft. Baldwin&#8217;s seat would go immediately to a special election in 2021, and Wisconsin of course is a purple-to-light-red state. So that would cripple Democrats&#8217; hypothetical Senate majority almost right away.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>That&#8217;s a good pick, Nathaniel, and could be a good way for Biden to broaden his base, considering his struggle to win the Latino vote in Nevada relative to Sanders. Although, of course, that has its limitations. What do we know about Cortez Masto&#8217;s politics, though? Isn’t she more of a moderate Democrat?</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>According to VoteView.com&#8217;s ideological scoring, she&#8217;s more or less around <a href="https://voteview.com/person/41700/catherine-marie-cortez-masto">the middle of the Democratic Party</a>, <i>maybe</i> slightly to the left of it.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I think because she is unknown to many voters, she (and/or Biden) could define her ideology however they want, which I think is a plus. (Although she is a member of the establishment, as evidenced by her leadership of the DSCC.)</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>OK, last round &#8212; take us away, Nathaniel.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>For my last pick, I&#8217;ll go with New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. She&#8217;s arguably the best pick among Democratic governors, many of whom were just elected in 2018 and therefore aren&#8217;t that experienced. However, Lujan Grisham also served six years in the House of Representatives, so I think her combined experience passes the bar. Plus, as a Latina, she is Democrats&#8217; only nonwhite woman governor.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>I was wondering if we were going to get around to including any governors in this draft!</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>I think some folks may be surprised she was the first governor taken!</p>
<p>But agreed, she has an experience level that surpasses some other newly-elected 2018 governors.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, even though many governors are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-like-how-their-governor-is-handling-the-coronavirus-outbreak/">getting high marks for how they’re handling the coronavirus crisis</a> right now, Democrats&#8217; gubernatorial bench is just pretty weak thanks to their drubbings in the 2010 and 2014 midterms. Plus, Democrats really love picking senators as running mates — <a href="http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/applying-conventional-criteria-to-bidens-unconventional-vice-presidential-pool/">15 of the last 18 Democratic vice-presidential candidates</a> have been senators!</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>Is that some foreshadowing of your last pick, Geoffrey?</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>I guess that may depend on what you do, Sarah!</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>So for my last pick, I&#8217;m going to go with Stacey Abrams. Working against her is the fact that she probably has the least amount of government experience of all the picks named. Yes, she was a Georgia state representative for 10 years, but she isn’t currently a public official. That said, her 2018 gubernatorial bid against Gov. Brian Kemp <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/georgia-governor">was close</a>, which is impressive in a red state like Georgia.</p>
<p>It’s a testament to how skilled of a politician she is too, considering she&#8217;s been able to stay in the national conversation, even though she&#8217;s not currently in office. The way she’s breaking the (unspoken) rules by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/26/stacey-abrams-joe-biden-vice-president-209352">actively campaigning for VP</a> is fascinating to watch, too. She had this powerful line in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/26/21237468/stacey-abrams-why-should-be-biden-vp-pick">a recent interview</a> where she explained her decision to push for the job, saying, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t raise your hand, people won&#8217;t see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I understand how her outspoken desire for the job will be portrayed as a power-hungry move and alienate some in the party because it violates the norms around how nominees pick their running mates, but I could also see that drive resonating with a lot of voters.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, Sarah, I’m also fascinated to see where her unorthodox strategy of campaigning for the job leads. But ultimately, I think Abrams would be a bad pick for Biden because there would be lots of questions about whether she is prepared to step into the role of president.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>&#8220;Unorthodox&#8221; is the right word &#8212; it&#8217;s atypical for someone to actively seek the vice presidency in the press.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I could see it rubbing a lot of people the wrong way, but also, I think there would be a racial and gendered element to any criticism. Would a white man be criticized for being outspoken about his ambitions?</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>Exactly, Nathaniel, that&#8217;s why I think it&#8217;s so interesting to see Abrams campaign for the job in this way. You&#8217;re right that it probably does irritate some party veterans, but I think it&#8217;s a powerful message that could resonate with a lot of rank-and-file voters.</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Abrams could be an energizing force for Biden’s campaign, too. She&#8217;s only 46 and has such a strong profile built off her narrow loss in the 2018 gubernatorial race in Georgia. Maybe there&#8217;s a case that she helps Biden with black voters and younger ones whom Biden didn&#8217;t do as well with during the primary.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>True. But OK, Geoffrey, take us home! Last pick!</p>
<p><b>geoffrey.skelley: </b>Alright, for my last pick, I was a bit torn because there are a fair number of directions I could see the Biden campaign going. But I&#8217;ll pick &#8220;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/09/gretchen-whitmer-governor-michigan-profile-2020-coronavirus-biden-vp-177791">that woman in Michigan</a>&#8221; &#8212; Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Her experience level is a question mark &#8212; she only won her office in 2018. But she&#8217;s had a lengthy political career in Michigan, and if her <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michiganders-approve-of-whitmer-on-coronavirus-despite-protests-poll-2020-4">approval holds up</a> on her handling of the coronavirus crisis despite becoming a national political figure, maybe that strengthens her resume enough.</p>
<p>While I, too, am skeptical of there being a significant home-state benefit to vice-presidential picks, Whitmer is from Michigan, a state Trump very narrowly carried in 2016. And more broadly, she might serve Biden well in the region as a whole. She&#8217;s also only 48 years old, making her one of the younger possibilities we&#8217;ve mentioned today. That could give the ticket a nice generational balance.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, on the experience front, I dunno&#8230; She might get a pass from the media or low-information voters because she&#8217;s been governor during this time of crisis. And she was the Democratic leader in the Michigan Senate, which isn&#8217;t nothing. But I just don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s enough to be prepared to be leader of the free world.</p>
<p>Her handling of the coronavirus crisis may not be the selling point that many analysts assume it is either. She got in trouble recently for giving a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michigan-cancels-contract-with-two-democratic-linked-firms-that-had-been-tapped-to-track-coronavirus/2020/04/21/161a23ce-8413-11ea-ae26-989cfce1c7c7_story.html">no-bid state contract</a> for tracking coronavirus cases to Democratic-connected firms. That&#8217;s the kind of rookie mistake that comes with inexperience.</p>
<p>Plus, how would it look for her to take a leave of absence from the governorship amid a pandemic to go campaign?</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>One other thing that’s been weighing on me as we&#8217;ve chatted about Biden’s potential VPs is the kind of weird place we find ourselves in. On the one hand, we know Biden is going to pick a woman, but we just don’t know who.</p>
<p>And that’s complicated because whomever Biden picks, she&#8217;ll be tasked with defending his alleged track record with women, which is daunting &#8212; there&#8217;s the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/joe-biden-accuser-accusations-allegations.html">inappropriate touching claims</a> from earlier in 2019 and now former Biden staffer Tara Reade has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html">accused Biden of sexual assault</a>. That&#8217;s something that his VP, especially because she will be a woman, will have to speak to no matter who she is.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, I’ll be watching how these latest allegations play out.</p>
<p>For whatever reason — no room in the coronavirus news cycle? media bias? Trump and Republicans aren&#8217;t harping on it? — Reade&#8217;s allegations haven&#8217;t gotten a lot of traction yet. But with Business Insider finding someone whom Reade <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-neighbor-corroborates-joe-bidens-accuser-2020-4">told about the alleged assault</a> at the time, it seems like they aren&#8217;t going away either.</p>
<p>So far, though, female politicians (not that women are the only ones who care about this issue), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/leading-democrats-stand-behind-biden-after-sexual-assault-allegation-11588092623">including some we mentioned in this chat</a>, are still supporting Biden, or at least aren&#8217;t saying anything about the accusations. Hillary Clinton even <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/28/hillary-clinton-endorse-joe-biden-president/3040742001/">endorsed Biden</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p><b>sarahf:</b> Yeah, it’s hard at this point to say how this will all shake out for Biden. If more women step forward or if we get more corroboration around Reade’s allegations, I have to think this causes Biden serious trouble. But even if that doesn’t happen, whoever Biden’s VP is will have to talk about his relationship with women, and as Rebecca Traister wrote for New York Magazine, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/04/the-biden-trap-woman-vice-president.html">that might be a hard pill to swallow</a>.</p>

<p>The NFL’s first virtual draft went off looking pretty effortless (unless you happen to be Roger Goodell’s armchair) and with some interesting surprises. We start our breakdown of the draft by talking about the Green Bay Packers’ selection of Utah State QB Jordan Love. On the surface, it makes sense to grab a backup for Aaron Rodgers, who certainly isn’t getting any younger. But it’s not at all clear that Love was worth trading up for, or if Green Bay is missing the trees for the forest here. It might have made more sense for the Packers &#8212; who went to the NFC title game just last season &#8212; to have adopted a draft strategy that would help them win right now. Still, we think this might have been the most fun draft in years &#8212; the heartwarming interactions between players and their families were better than any number of bow ties.</p>
<p>Next, we bring back an old segment, “Get Off My Court,” to talk about the fracas that erupted on Twitter last week when <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1253474117489176578?s=20">ESPN’s Adam Schefter</a> implied that the NFL draft was the first live sporting event since the coronavirus lockdown in the U.S. His own network had aired the WNBA draft just six days earlier, as no small number of folks online were quick to remind him. This specific take may not matter in the grand scheme of things, but we are interested in the larger attitudes toward women’s sports and the need people feel to insert themselves into dialogues around sports they profess not to care about or find “legitimate.” We’re not quite sure where the impulse to police which sports leagues actually count comes from, and acceptance of professional female athletes still varies quite a bit from sport to sport. We’re just glad that, ever so slowly, more people are starting to chip away at the inherent hypocrisy in these attitudes &#8212; and that Natasha Cloud of the Washington Mystics <a href="https://twitter.com/T_Cloud4/status/1253770704392241152?s=20">will call out Twitter trolls</a> (NSFW) at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>Finally, in the Rabbit Hole, Neil walks us through how he and fellow FiveThirtyEight contributor <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/ryan-best/">Ryan Best</a> put together an interactive of classic NBA games &#8212; and how to quantify what makes an old game exciting to watch again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/hall-of-good/">Hall of Pretty Damn Good Players</a>, our tribute to the overlooked athletes who haven’t gotten the respect they deserve over the years. In the first couple of installments, we highlighted two baseball players who were overlooked perhaps because they <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kenny-lofton-welcome-to-our-hall-of-pretty-damn-good-players/">changed teams too often</a> or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/chase-utley-slid-his-way-into-our-hall-of-pretty-damn-good-players/">excelled at too many little things</a> without gaudy stats. But today we’ll look at a basketball player who fits <i>both</i> of those descriptions: former Detroit Pistons big man Ben Wallace.</p>

<p>Wallace was a finalist for the Hall of Fame <a href="http://www.nba.com/article/2019/02/15/thirteen-finalists-announced-hall-fame-official-release">in 2019</a> but was <a href="http://www.nba.com/hall-of-fame-class-2020-finalists">left off the list</a> in 2020. According to Basketball-Reference.com’s <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/hof_prob.html">Hall of Fame probability model</a>, Wallace has only a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html">45.3 percent chance</a> of getting in, based on his traditional stats and accomplishments. He might make it to Springfield someday, but his candidacy is no sure thing.</p>
<p>(Sidebar: If any members of the Hall of Pretty Damn Good Players eventually make their actual Hall of Fame, do we revoke their HoPDGP status? Nah. We can just say we had them in <i>our</i> Hall first.)</p>
<p>Forget about the Hall of Fame, though &#8212; Wallace took an unlikely path just to make it to the Hall of Pretty Damn Good. Born in rural Alabama, growing up as one of 11 children, Wallace went undrafted out of Division II Virginia Union and briefly played pro ball in Italy before signing with the Washington Bullets in 1996. He <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/WSB/1997.html">offered few signs of greatness</a> in 34 games as a rookie, shooting 35 percent from the floor and logging fewer than six minutes a contest. And just as he was coming into his own as a defender and rebounder over the next few seasons, Wallace was traded twice in the span of less than a year. At best, this looked like the start to a journeyman’s career in the NBA.</p>
<p>When Pistons All-Star Grant Hill chose to join the Magic, Wallace landed in Detroit as part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal">sign-and-trade deal</a>. But once he was in the Motor City, Wallace became one of the most iconic players &#8212; on one of the most iconic teams &#8212; of his era. He wasn’t a scorer, <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wallabe01.html#per_game::29">never cracking double-digit points per game</a> in any season of his career. He couldn’t shoot a lick &#8212; witness his career rates of 14 percent on 3-pointers and 41 percent on free throws. Yet Wallace still made his presence felt, serving as the interior backbone of a Pistons team that rose from 32 wins in the first year he arrived to an NBA championship just three seasons later.</p>
<p>Wallace’s own numbers during that run were special. During his final five seasons in Detroit (from 2001-02 through 2005-06), Wallace had the league’s <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;type=advanced&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=2002&amp;year_max=2006&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=mp&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=5000&amp;order_by=trb_pct">second-best rebound rate</a>, <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;type=advanced&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=2002&amp;year_max=2006&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=mp&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=5000&amp;order_by=blk_pct">eighth-best block rate</a> and even its <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;type=advanced&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=2002&amp;year_max=2006&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=mp&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=5000&amp;order_by=stl_pct">29th-best steal rate</a> (a very high placement for a big man). According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-raptor-our-new-metric-for-the-modern-nba/">our RAPTOR player ratings</a>, Wallace was the very best regular-season defensive player in the NBA over that span by a very wide margin &#8212; leading No. 2 Tim Duncan by 2.0 points per 100 possessions &#8212; and was one of the few defenders at the top of the leaderboard to improve his rating in the playoffs.</p>

<p>At the same time, Wallace <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wallabe01.html#2002-2006-sum:per_poss">accounted for 107.2 points per 100 individual possessions</a> on the offensive end during those seasons, well above <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html">the league average</a> of 104.7 points per 100 possessions. Granted, he had a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-did-basketball-end-up-with-four-versions-and-counting-of-one-stat/">usage rate</a> of only 12.5 percent, so he was far from a major offensive factor for the Pistons. But Wallace wasn’t a detriment to the offense when he was asked to finish the occasional play.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Wallace elevated Detroit to another level when he got in the game. Oftentimes we’ll see big individual rebounders <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/flowers-feature-nba-preview-clippers-2.png?w=575">not actually improve their team’s rebounding rates</a> when on the court &#8212; but not so with Wallace. He boosted the Pistons’ rebounding numbers on both offense and defense, to the point that Detroit outrebounded opponents with Wallace in the game and got outrebounded without him. He also had net positive effects on the rest of the Pistons’ defensive numbers while in the game: Opponents shot worse, had more shots blocked, got the ball stolen more and scored far fewer points per 100 possessions when Wallace patrolled the paint:</p>

<p>Wallace wasn’t the only great defender on the early-to-mid-2000s Pistons, of course. After the team <a href="https://www.nba.com/pistons/news/rwallace_040219.html">acquired power forward Rasheed Wallace</a> &#8212; no relation &#8212; before the 2004 trade deadline, Detroit’s <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/lineup_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;lineup_type=5-man&amp;output=total&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;year_id=2004&amp;team_id=DET&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;order_by=mp">primary lineup</a> included Ben (+7.3 RAPTOR defensive rating in the 2003-04 season) and Rasheed (+2.3) Wallace, Tayshaun Prince (+0.9) and Chauncey Billups (+0.3), a combo that <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/lineup_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;lineup_type=4-man&amp;output=total&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;year_id=2004&amp;team_id=DET&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;order_by=mp">played together</a> for 541 of the team’s 1,124 total minutes in the 2004 playoffs. (The other lineup slot was filled by shooting guard Richard Hamilton, who had a -0.2 defensive RAPTOR if we include the playoffs.) With so many plus defenders, it’s no wonder that group came together for arguably the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;team_seed_cmp=eq&amp;opp_seed_cmp=eq&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2020&amp;is_range=N&amp;game_num_type=team&amp;c1stat=mp&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=3600&amp;order_by=opp_off_rtg&amp;order_by_asc=Y">greatest team defensive performance in recent postseason history</a>. But the man they called “Big Ben” was clearly the driving force at the center of it all.</p>
<p>Similar to Chase Utley, whom we covered in last week’s HoPDGP, Ben Wallace was statistically the most valuable player on a team that won one championship and came close to more titles. The core lineup from above was together for Detroit’s playoff runs from 2004 through 2006, and in that span, Ben Wallace led the Pistons with 10.9 RAPTOR wins above replacement, edging out Billups’s tally of 10.5.</p>

<p>Like Utley’s Phillies, these were also teams without many clear Hall of Fame picks. Basketball-Reference gives Billups an 84.4 percent chance of punching his ticket to Springfield, though he <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/hof.fcgi">hasn’t gotten there yet</a>. Rasheed Wallace has evolved into a beloved player in retrospect, but his Hall probability is just 8.6 percent &#8212; and that’s largely warranted, if you <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/9160248/nba-hall-monitor-asks-rasheed-wallace-hall-famer">break down the merits of his candidacy</a>. Hamilton (1.8 percent) and Prince (0.1 percent) have even longer odds of enshrinement. (For now, <a href="http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/larry-brown">coach Larry Brown</a> and GM Joe Dumars &#8212; who made Springfield as a player &#8212; are the only Hall of Famers associated with that Pistons era.) This group was criminally underrated at the time &#8212; they were <a href="https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/nba-finals-historical-series-odds-list">huge underdogs against the Lakers</a> going into the 2004 Finals &#8212; and it mostly remains that way, which makes the blue-collar Ben Wallace their perfect patron saint.</p>
<p>After leaving Detroit for Chicago and then Cleveland, Wallace wasn’t the same dominating force he had been with the Pistons. He cracked 5.0 WAR on two other occasions (with the Bulls in 2006-07 and then in a renaissance season back with Detroit in 2009-10 at age 35), but he’d done his most notable work by the age of 31, when his first stint in Detroit ended. Wallace’s defensive peak was as impressive as we’ve seen from any player since David Robinson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or maybe even Bill Russell.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="23" href="#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Wallace has the second-highest career defensive RAPTOR (+5.0) of anyone with at least 15,000 minutes since 1976-77, just behind Robinson (+5.2). That includes others in the conversation such as Hakeem Olajuwon and Draymond Green (+4.6 each), Tim Duncan (+3.7), Anthony Davis (+3.4), Patrick Ewing (+3.3), Kevin Garnett (+3.1), Dikembe Mutombo (+2.9) and Dwight Howard and Alonzo Mourning (+2.4 each).&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-23">23</sup></a> And that might be enough to earn him a place in the real Basketball Hall of Fame. But at the very least, it makes him a first-ballot member of our Hall of Pretty Damn Good Players.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been more than six weeks since Daniel<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="24" href="#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;He asked us not to use his full name so his company was not identifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-24">24</sup></a> last rode his bike to his office, where he works on the business operations team at a beverage company in the Pacific Northwest. At first he was apprehensive about working from home for the indefinite future, but within a few weeks he realized he was feeling more focused and productive than ever before. Even when restrictions are lifted on companies like his, he doesn’t expect to be spending a lot of time at the office. “I’ll go back for certain meetings if things start to reopen, but for the most part I think we’re going to be remote for the foreseeable future,” he said.</p>
<p>Daniel knows not everyone has that luxury. “I just keep saying to myself &#8212; I’m one of the lucky ones, because I’ve basically been able to continue working unaffected,” he said.</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 crisis continues, the ability to work from home could turn into one of the most important markers of privilege for American workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://john-joseph-horton.com/papers/remote_work.pdf">According to a survey</a> of 25,000 respondents fielded online April 1–5, more than 34 percent of people who were employed four weeks earlier reported that they used to commute to work, but were now working from home. Add that to the nearly 15 percent of respondents who said they were already working from home, and nearly half the country is teleworking.</p>
<p>But the ability to work remotely isn’t randomly distributed &#8212; it’s concentrated among people who are already more likely to have higher incomes and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-workers-are-most-vulnerable-to-the-economic-costs-of-the-coronavirus/">more stable employment</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/which-workers-bear-the-burden-of-social-distancing-policies/">In a recent working paper</a>, economists Simon Mongey, Laura Pilossoph and Alex Weinberg created two metrics to understand which workers will be hit especially hard by the coronavirus crisis, using data from the Labor Department. The first measures the extent to which a given occupation can be performed from home, and the other measures the amount of close proximity to other people that the job requires.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="25" href="#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;This measure builds on the work of University of Chicago economists Jonathan Dingel and Brent Neiman, which used Labor Department data to evaluate whether a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_White-Paper_Dingel_Neiman_3.2020.pdf&quot;&gt;job could plausibly be performed from home&lt;/a&gt;. Mongey, Pilossoph and Weinberg modified Dingel and Neiman&rsquo;s measure to evaluate the demographic characteristics of the workers in jobs where working from home was more likely, and jobs where working from home was less likely.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-25">25</sup></a> Sure enough, the jobs that are likely harder to do from home or are more likely to involve close physical proximity tend to be filled by people who are more economically vulnerable. For instance, jobs that are more difficult to work from home are disproportionately held by lower-income workers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_271205" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-271205" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/atdWolfe-WFH-0428-1.png" alt="" width="575" height="376" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/atdWolfe-WFH-0428-1.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/atdWolfe-WFH-0428-1.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>This research generally aligns with other recent studies that have found that the COVID-19 crisis has had a bigger economic impact on people with <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/04/21/about-half-of-lower-income-americans-report-household-job-or-wage-loss-due-to-covid-19/?utm_content=buffereaa81&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">lower incomes</a> and <a href="https://carleton.ca/economics/wp-content/uploads/cewp20-04.pdf">levels of education</a>. That dynamic is now going to force many poorer Americans to choose between their safety and a paycheck as the economy starts to reopen.</p>
<p>One of those workers who could soon be facing that unpleasant calculus is Erica Harrison, who lost her job setting up displays at a department store in Louisiana last month. She was already struggling to live on $12 per hour, and spent the last few weeks scrambling to get her unemployment insurance payments set up so she could buy groceries and make her car payments. Now she finally has enough money to support herself &#8212; but a few days after her benefits started to arrive, her supervisor called to ask how she’d feel about coming back to her job if the store was able to reopen.</p>
<p>The idea of returning to work knocked her back on her heels. “It’s a terrifying thought because the risk of getting sick is so high,” Harrison said. “It’s literally my job to touch everything in the store &#8212; the fixtures, the mannequins, the plexiglass.” She lives with her mother, who recently recovered from heart surgery, so Harrison is especially concerned about spreading the virus to family members. But she had to take her supervisor’s question seriously. She lost her health insurance along with her job, and she’s wary of turning down work in the midst of a recession. And she would probably <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-georgia-worker/americans-too-scared-to-go-to-work-risk-losing-unemployment-aid-experts-say-idUSKCN2251RD">no longer qualify</a> for unemployment benefits if she was offered her job back and chose not to return. “In my mind it pretty much comes down to: do you care more about your money or your health?” she said. “I wish there was a way for me to stay indoors and keep getting my paycheck. But that option is not available to me.”</p>
<p>The problem for Harrison isn’t simply that it’s impossible to do her job from home. Her job also involves close contact with other people, putting her at higher risk for contracting or spreading the virus if she did come back to work. She isn’t alone. The economists’ research shows that jobs that require close physical proximity are disproportionately occupied by poorer Americans.</p>
<figure id="attachment_271206" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-271206" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/atdWolfe-WFH-0428-3.png" alt="" width="575" height="353" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/atdWolfe-WFH-0428-3.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/atdWolfe-WFH-0428-3.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>And the workers who are disproportionately represented in both kinds of jobs are also more economically vulnerable. Many of the jobs where working from home is more difficult are held by workers without a college degree, and those workers are also overrepresented in jobs that require more face-to-face interaction. The same is true of lower-income workers, who make up more than half of workers in jobs where working from home is unlikely to be feasible <i>and</i> of jobs that involve closer proximity to other people.</p>
<figure id="attachment_271207" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-271207" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/atdWolfe-WFH-0428-2.png" alt="" width="575" height="647" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/atdWolfe-WFH-0428-2.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/atdWolfe-WFH-0428-2.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>This means that workers who were hit hardest by the economic shutdown are also disproportionately likely to suffer as the recovery unfolds. In places where the economy is being reopened more quickly, they’ll have to confront the prospect of returning to dangerous work before the virus is fully contained. In places where economic activity is remaining frozen for longer &#8212; or only only <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/26/coronavirus-colorado-stay-at-home-update-covid-19/">partially resuming</a> &#8212; they may face longer-term unemployment if their employers can’t reopen quickly or fully. Unemployment benefits can be a salve, especially since the federal government temporarily boosted the amounts by $600 per week. But many Americans’ benefits have not been processed. And that extra money <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/coronavirus/600-weekly-unemployment-payments-to-run-through-end-of-july">is currently scheduled to stop at the end of July</a>. But the economy <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/social-distancing-could-last-months-white-house-coronavirus-coordinator-says/2020/04/26/ad8d2f84-87de-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a_story.html">probably won’t be back to normal</a> by then. “If the recovery begins by bringing back workers who are in jobs where they don’t have a lot of contact with other people, that will mean people in high physical proximity jobs will be hurting economically for longer,” Mongey said.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone who has transitioned to teleworking is leading a charmed life. Daniel was almost apologetic about his good fortune &#8212; he’s young, with no kids and a well-paying job, leaving him plenty of time for Zoom catch-ups with friends and road biking. In some ways, his financial situation has actually improved. He and his partner are rarely ordering out for food, and he got a flood of refunds as races he’d signed up to run over the next few months were canceled.</p>
<p>But other workers, like Kyrie Martin, a high school math teacher in California, told us they can’t wait to get back to their old, analog workplace. “It’s maddening enough to try to teach AP Statistics remotely without my first-grade daughter coming in and playing hangman with the students on the whiteboard behind me,” Martin said. But she was quick to add how lucky she felt to still be working.</p>
<p>And Martin’s job as a public school teacher probably isn’t in danger of disappearing. As Harrison weighed her options, she was alarmed to see reports that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/business/coronavirus-department-stores-neiman-marcus.html">big department stores like Neiman Marcus</a> have been among the first economic casualties of the economic crisis. She wonders if her employer might be next, even if it manages to reopen. “If I’m questioning if it’s safe to come to work for a paycheck, who’s going to want to come in of their own free will to shop?” she said.</p>
<p>It’s not an irrational fear. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24373.pdf">After past recessions</a>, some of the lost jobs <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w18334.pdf?mod=article_inline">didn’t come back when the recovery began</a> &#8212; particularly lower-paying positions that don’t require specialized skills.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Harrison’s days are full of anxiety and boredom. “When this quarantine started, I tried to get up early, keep up a routine, stay productive, but that’s kind of fallen apart,” she said. “Pretty much my only regular activity these days is going to the store to see if they’ve restocked on Lysol.” When her unemployment benefits started to hit her bank account, she could at least stop worrying about covering next month’s car payment. But she’s not optimistic about what will happen when the economy begins to open up again. “When things start going back to normal, I think I’m going to end up sick or unemployed.”</p>
