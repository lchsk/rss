										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I wrote about how New York has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-york-coronavirus-curve/">successfully bent the coronavirus curve</a> after an extended period of social distancing. The evidence this week is even stronger. As of Wednesday, just <a href="https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Map?%3Aembed=yes&amp;%3Atoolbar=no&amp;%3Atabs=n">27.6 percent of newly reported COVID-19 tests in New York City were positive</a>, still a fairly high rate &#8212; but substantially down from a peak of 59.4 percent on March 29. Other states are also seeing a decline in new cases &#8212; Louisiana, in particular, has seen a <a href="https://twitter.com/Crimealytics/status/1253028684623118336?s=20">highly encouraging turnaround.</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, New York and Louisiana aren’t the norm. In fact, there isn’t really any norm. While the situation in many states is improving, in <b><i>nearly half </i></b><b>of all states in the U.S., there are as many COVID-19 cases as ever, and in some cases, even more</b>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_270997" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-270997" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-covidpeak-1.png" alt="" width="575" height="582" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-covidpeak-1.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-covidpeak-1.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>As I’ve written before, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/">the number of new confirmed cases can be a deceptive indicator of how much the coronavirus is spreading</a> unless you also account for how many tests are conducted. But the stubborn persistence of the novel coronavirus in many parts of the country isn’t just an artifact of rising testing volume.</p>
<p>In fact, the <a href="https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking/status/1253071865024667648?s=20">number of tests has been at a plateau for several weeks in the U.S.</a> But that isn’t necessarily the case in individual states. So in this article, I’ll go through some additional calculations to estimate how the share of positive tests has changed in each state over the past several weeks. Before I go into more detail, though, you should know that the conclusions would largely be the same with whatever metric I chose. Newly diagnosed cases, the positive test rate and the number of deaths are all showing progress in <i>some</i> states &#8212; but getting <i>worse</i> in plenty of others. In other words, the United States has not yet turned the corner nationwide.</p>
<h2>How to estimate positive test rates</h2>
<p>All 50 states and the District of Columbia now make some effort to report both positive and negative test results. In theory, that should allow us to calculate the share of tests that are positive and how that has changed over time. Given that the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/experts-say-the-coronavirus-outlook-has-worsened-but-the-trajectory-is-still-unclear/">large majority of infections are probably undetected</a>, no measure is perfect. But our analysis of various testing scenarios suggests that the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/us-coronavirus-outbreak-out-control-test-positivity-rate/610132/">rate of positive tests</a> is usually a truer indicator of the actual, underlying spread of the disease than the raw number of positives.</p>
<p>However, while most states diligently update their data on the number of positive tests, the quality of reporting on negative tests varies. For instance, while New York publishes <a href="https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Map?%3Aembed=yes&amp;%3Atoolbar=no&amp;%3Atabs=n">detailed reports</a> on the number of positive and negative tests each day, California takes a more casual approach with reporting its negatives. On Wednesday, for example, California reported more than 160,000 “new” negative tests &#8212; as compared with just 7,000 negatives on Tuesday. It is highly unlikely that these new tests were <i>actually</i> conducted on Wednesday. Instead, California was <a href="https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking/status/1253073282435174400?s=20">likely clearing a backlog</a> of tests that had been conducted days &#8212; or even weeks &#8212; ago.</p>
<p>Having looked at a lot of this data, I know that California isn’t the only offender. So I developed some techniques to smooth erratic reporting on negative tests, which should allow us to come up with reasonable estimates even in states that don’t have great data. (Because this is a story about the coronavirus and not one on methods for handling dodgy data, feel free to skip to the next section if you don’t care about the nitty gritty.) In any event, I’ll be brief. It’s basically a three-step process:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">First, if a state has days where it skips reporting any testing at all &#8212; that is, it doesn’t report on the existence of any new positive <i>or</i> negative tests &#8212; I spread the data evenly over any skipped days once it does report new tests. For instance, if Alabama doesn’t report any data on Sunday, and then reports the existence of 100 new tests on Monday, I assign half of those tests to Sunday and keep half of them on Monday.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Second, because reporting on negative tests has become more comprehensive over time, I pick a date in each state when its reporting on negative tests first became “usable.” Usable is a low bar and the date varies wildly from state to state. A state’s reporting can still be erratic; that’s what the next step is designed to deal with. But to be usable, a state has to be making some effort at being comprehensive &#8212; for instance, by including data both from state-run laboratories and private labs among its negative tests counts. It’s challenging though to pinpoint when a state’s data is usable, and something that has to be done by hand.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="1" href="#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;I examined the data in each state, looking for abrupt jumps in the number of negatives reported, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200324022544/https://covidtracking.com/data/&quot;&gt;consulted archived notes at The COVID Tracking Project&lt;/a&gt; for what the state&rsquo;s reporting standards were at any given time. Some states have had usable data going all the way back to early March; for others, it has only happened in the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Third, within the window where a state’s negative test data is usable, I apply a <a href="https://www.stata.com/manuals13/rlpoly.pdf">polynomial smoother</a> to the negative-test data to iron out daily fluctuations in reporting. The smoother is set to a pretty conservative setting, as we’re mostly interested in getting a sense of the broad directionality of a state’s testing regime &#8212; that is, whether tests are increasing quickly, increasing slowly, stagnant, or even declining. Outside of a state’s usable window, we use data for states that <i>did</i> have reliable reporting to estimate how fast test volume was increasing or decreasing. For instance, if Utah’s data did not become usable until March 20, but we know that the average state with usable data was doing 50 percent more testing on March 20 than on March 10, we can use that to extrapolate how much testing Utah may have been doing on March 10.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that &#8212; other than the first step &#8212; we apply this process only to a state’s reporting on <i>negative</i> tests, since reporting on positive tests is usually more timely and reliable.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="2" href="#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;That is, we take a state&rsquo;s positive tests reported &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; plus &lt;i&gt;smoothed&lt;/i&gt; negative tests, to estimate how many tests it actually did. Although this might sound like a cockamamie strategy, I think it&rsquo;s probably the least-worst option for trying to capture how many tests a state is actually doing at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a> The main issue with positive test reporting tends to be day-of-week effects: Some states tend to be better about reporting data on weekdays than on weekends. The simplest workaround for this is simply to look at one full week’s worth of data at a time, which is what we’ll do in the next section.</p>
<h2>Where coronavirus cases are growing and shrinking</h2>
<p>For each state, I’ve estimated the share of COVID-19 tests that produced positive results for the past five weeks &#8212; that is, for the seven-day periods ending on March 25, April 1, April 8, April 15 and April 22.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="3" href="#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Before March 25, the data is just too erratic in most states, even with all the adjustments that we might make.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-3">3</sup></a> All data, subject to the adjustments I described in the previous section, comes from <a href="https://covidtracking.com/">The COVID Tracking Project</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the states where things are still getting worse, or at least are not getting better &#8212; places where the share of positive tests hit a new high as of April 22.</p>

<p>Eighteen states and the District of Columbia made this list, which together are home to almost 95 million people. So if you hear something about how the situation is turning the corner in the U.S., that’s sort of a fiction. With so few people traveling, we’re really seeing a lot of statewide and local epidemics more than a national one, and some of those epidemics are still getting worse.</p>
<p>The states where cases are growing are somewhat varied, too &#8212; about evenly mixed between red states and blue states. They are mostly concentrated in the Midwest, although a series of Eastern Seaboard states &#8212; North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Delaware &#8212; also make the list. Connecticut is also on the list, which is something of a surprise since the turnaround is clear in neighboring New York.</p>
<p>On a percentage basis, the biggest week-over-week increases have been in Midwestern states, though: specifically Iowa, Ohio, Nebraska and North Dakota. But these increases aren’t necessarily uniformly distributed throughout the general population. <a href="https://time.com/5825030/ohio-mass-testing-prisons-coronavirus-outbreaks/">Ohio is having huge problems in its prisons</a>, and meat-processing plants have been <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/04/22/meat-packing-plants-covid-may-force-choice-worker-health-food/2995232001/">centers of outbreaks in states such as Iowa</a>. These outbreaks go to show the limitations of social distancing. It doesn’t work for people who can’t afford to do it, which means that even in places that seem to be controlling the outbreak, there can still be <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/27/a-new-doctor-faces-the-coronavirus-in-queens">huge numbers of cases among essential workers</a>.</p>
<p>Next up, states that have &#8212; at best &#8212; tentatively turned the corner, or where the peak of positive test rates came in the week that ended April 15.</p>

<p>Other than perhaps Alabama, where the share of positive tests fell from 12 percent a week ago to 8 percent this week, all of these states have made at best tentative progress and are only a percentage point or two off their peak of positive tests rates.</p>
<p>So in other words, in about half the country &#8212; the 18 states in the previous table plus most of the ones in this table and a couple in the next table &#8212; new coronavirus cases are still at or near their peak, after accounting for changes in testing volume.</p>
<p>But there are some encouraging stories: There are 20 states where positive test rates peaked two weeks ago, on April 8.</p>

<p>If you look at the data in more detail, though, it’s actually a bit of a mixed bag. Nevada, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Wisconsin are only tenuous members of this club; their rates of positive tests were nearly as high on April 22 as they were on April 8.</p>
<p>However, the decline in positive test rates has been more robust in New York, Louisiana and Michigan, all of which had very bad outbreaks before.</p>
<p>Florida and Georgia, controversial for their plans to reopen <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/florida-continues-reopening-beaches-with-social-distancing/2223461/">beaches</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/22/coronairus-trump-disagrees-georgia-gov-brian-kemp-reopening/3008524001/">businesses</a>, fall somewhere in between, with medium-sized decreases in positive test rates. Georgia has actually seen <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/state/georgia">a continued increase in its raw number of positive tests</a>, although it is doing more testing, so its share of positive tests has declined somewhat.</p>
<p>There are a number of Southern states on the declining list. Although the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/warm-weather-coronavirus.html">role that weather plays in the spread of COVID-19 is disputed</a>, it’s worth noting that late March was <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/la/kenner/KMSY/date/2020-3">fairly warm in states such as Louisiana</a>, which could have been a factor in these states.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a few states where the estimated rate of positive tests peaked <i>three</i> weeks ago, in the period ending on April 1.</p>

<p>Most of these states are in the West — and in the case of Washington and California, states that enacted fairly aggressive social distancing measures earlier because the coronavirus hit them sooner than other parts of the U.S. Although, it’s hard to know exactly what is happening in California given how erratic its reporting on negative tests has been.</p>
<p>Remote, geographically isolated states such as Montana and Maine (plus Alaska and Hawaii from the previous list) may have some advantages in containing the spread of COVID-19., though. Namely, they may be rural enough that human interaction is slightly less common. They’re also low-population states that never had terribly bad outbreaks, which <a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/04/05/meet-the-team-of-alaskans-trying-to-trace-and-contain-every-case-of-covid-19/">may make “contact tracing” possible</a>, or the practice of finding and monitoring people exposed to the disease; this is easier to do when you have a finite number of cases.</p>
<h2>Where the fight against COVID-19 stands</h2>
<p>So, what to make of all of this &#8212; or at least, what to make of the states where the situation is not improving?</p>
<p>A week or two ago, we might have said just to give it more time since there’s a substantial lag between when people get infected and when their test shows up in the data. That <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/">lag is typically two or three weeks</a>, though. Since most of the country began implementing social distancing measures in mid-to-late March, we should see the effects of it in the data by now.</p>
<p>And in fact, we <i>do</i> see those effects of social distancing. Cases are decreasing in about half the country. In places where the data suggests COVID-19 cases are still increasing, they tend <i>not</i> to be increasing all that fast — especially when you compare where we are now to the exponential rates of spread we saw initially in New York and Louisiana, which reflected the period before social distancing measures were in place. Of course, the catch here is the spread would likely accelerate again if restrictions were lifted.</p>
<p>Additionally, while these social distancing efforts are almost certainly <i>flattening</i> the curve, the somewhat lax American version of social distancing may not be enough to <i>bend</i> the curve all on its own. In epidemiological terms, bending the curve means getting <i>R</i> &#8212; the <a href="https://www.healthknowledge.org.uk/public-health-textbook/research-methods/1a-epidemiology/epidemic-theory">effective reproduction number</a> &#8212; under 1, so that each person who acquires COVID-19 spreads it to less than one new person. If <i>R</i> is less than 1, a disease will begin to die out<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="4" href="#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;It will die out slowly, however, if R is just slightly below 1.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></a>, but if it’s <i>above</i> 1, the disease will keep spreading. And if<i> R</i> is <i>near</i> 1, the curve will flatten into a long plateau but not turn downward, which may be the case in some states.</p>
<p>We must also consider the role of the essential workforce, since it doesn’t get the full benefits of social distancing like some of us do. If <i>R</i> is 0.6 among white-collar workers who can work from home, but 1.2 among U.S. Postal Service drivers, 1.7 among factory workers, 3.0 among nurses in hospitals and 4.6 among prison guards, the disease may continue to spread, but with that spread being concentrated among certain occupations and populations. Not that there is necessarily a better way around this, but carving out large categories of essential workers can make it hard for a community as whole to get its <i>R</i> below 1.</p>
<p>Indeed, the states where COVID-19 cases are decreasing often have some other helpful factors in addition to social distancing. As I mentioned, geographically isolated states seem to be doing better, as do warm-weather states. Because the outbreaks were <i>so</i> bad in New York and Louisiana, they may be benefiting from <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1252703694380040192?s=20"><i>some</i> degree of herd immunity</a>; enough people had COVID-19 there that it may be harder to spread it, assuming that they are immune. (Immunity is a complicated subject, but it’s likely that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-immunity.html">most people are immune for some period of time</a>.)<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="5" href="#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Note that herd immunity is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/21/facebook-posts/herd-immunity-curbed-covid-deaths-no/&quot;&gt;unlikely to be much help&lt;/a&gt; outside of the worst-affected regions such as New York and Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a>. These factors aren’t necessarily enormously important; warm weather is highly unlikely to be a cure-all, for instance. But something that’s enough to tip <i>R</i> from being just above 1 to just <i>below</i> 1 — say, from 1.15 to 0.85 — will have fairly noticeable effects over the course of a few weeks.</p>
<p>In short, the United States <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/its-not-too-late-to-go-on-offense-against-the-coronavirus">desperately needs to work on techniques <i>in addition</i> to social distancing</a> to fight the spread, including better testing, case-tracking, quarantining of sick individuals, and better sanitation and hygiene. Social distancing has likely been very helpful to slow the spread and, in many states, even reverse it. But if it’s the <i>only</i> tool we’re employing &#8212; and it’s a costly tool to wield &#8212; it may only be enough to allow us to fight the coronavirus to a draw.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is increasing evidence that New York City and New York state are turning a corner in their efforts to fight back COVID-19, and the timing suggests that the shifts may be a result of social distancing measures.</p>
<p>Whether the state and city have merely flattened the curve to a plateau or actually begin to turn it around is somewhat ambiguous. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1249721888416333826?s=20">daily press conferences</a>, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has described recent data on hospitalizations as good news and emphasized that the curve has become quite flat. On Tuesday, for the first time, New York reported a <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1250085474401693697?s=20">net decline in hospitalizations</a>, although it remains to be seen whether the trend can be sustained.. The number of people reported as dying from COVID-19 has <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1250086893087318022?s=20">also been at a plateau in recent days</a>.</p>
<p>But data on the share of New Yorkers who are testing positive for COVID-19 suggests that the curve has not merely flattened but probably begun to turn down. Among tests conducted Monday, April 13 (and reported on Tuesday afternoon), 34.5 percent were positive, down from a peak of 50.4 percent on Tuesday, March 31. The decline in the share of positive tests has been fairly robust across most parts of New York state, including in all five New York City’s five boroughs, although some more clearly so than others.</p>
<p>Still, if the decline has been steady, it has so far been slow. That may imply that while current social distancing measures are enough to gradually decrease the number of new cases in New York, the number of new cases may continue to simmer at relatively high levels for several weeks or longer &#8212; and that they could increase again if these measures are relaxed.</p>
<p>All the numbers in this article come from <a href="https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-Map?%3Aembed=yes&amp;%3Atoolbar=no&amp;%3Atabs=n">publicly available data from the New York State Department of Health</a>. (There’s also a <a href="https://data.ny.gov/browse?tags=covid-19">downloadable version</a>.) The state has been releasing detailed reports on the number of positive and negative tests conducted each day in each county in the state, including in the boroughs of New York City (which are each their own counties).</p>
<p>Information on the overall number of tests &#8212; both positive and negative &#8212; is critical, because without it, apparent changes in the number of cases can <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/">reflect changes in testing volume</a> rather than the actual incidence of disease in the population. In tests conducted on Sunday and disclosed on the state’s website on Monday, for example, 6,337 New Yorkers were found to have COVID-19, the lowest number of new cases since March 24 and a seemingly huge decline from the 10,575 new cases found on Thursday. (The number ticked up again a bit in tests conducted on Monday, to 7,177.) However, perhaps because of Easter, only 16,756 tests were conducted on Sunday, the lowest number since March 31. (By comparison, 26,336 tests were done on Thursday.) There are many such fluctuations in the data:</p>
<figure id="attachment_270009" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-270009" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-coronyc-0414-1a.png" alt="" width="575" height="475" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-coronyc-0414-1a.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-coronyc-0414-1a.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>Evaluating the share of tests that turned up positive can paint a clearer picture. The rate of positive tests was climbing statewide through March 31 but has been falling slowly since then.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="6" href="#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Note that, although I drew a trend line in the chart &amp;#8212; specifically, a trend line the uses STATA&rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stata.com/manuals13/rlpoly.pdf&quot;&gt;lpoly function&lt;/a&gt; with a bandwidth of 2 and a degree of 1, and that weights each day&rsquo;s results by the total number of tests conducted &amp;#8212; the numbers are pretty smooth even without it.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-6">6</sup></a></p>
<figure id="attachment_270010" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-270010" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-coronyc-0414-2a.png" alt="" width="575" height="489" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-coronyc-0414-2a.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-coronyc-0414-2a.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>It turns out that this Sunday <i>was</i> a pretty good day for New York. The share of tests returning positive results on Sunday was relatively low (37.8 percent) &#8212; in fact, the lowest in almost three weeks up to that point (since March 25), although Monday’s figure was lower still. It just wasn’t quite as good a day as the raw numbers imply because of the relative lack of testing.</p>
<p>Adjusting for testing volume doesn’t answer every question. It could be that New York’s criteria for getting tests are becoming more liberal, or more conservative, which could affect positive test rates. These tests are hardly coming from a random sample of the population, in other words.</p>
<p>The still-high rate of positive tests among those who are being tested suggests that there are probably a very large number of undiagnosed cases in New York (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/experts-think-were-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-but-hospitalizations-havent-peaked-yet/">as there are in other places</a>). It may even be that literally millions of people in New York City have or had COVID-19. Testing of pregnant women at one NYC hospital late last month and early this month, as <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009316">reported</a> in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, found that around 14 percent of <i>asymptomatic</i> women had COVID-19, and that was at an earlier point in the epidemic than the one we find ourselves in now.</p>
<p>Still, across <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/">most of the scenarios that I described in my earlier article on testing</a>, the share of people who tested positive was a more accurate reflection of the shape of the epidemic curve than the raw number of positive tests was without adjusting for testing volume. (Feel free to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covidia_1.05_updated.xlsx">download our Excel sheet</a> and explore your own assumptions.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, changes in the share of positive tests in New York state are <i>not</i> merely a reflection of where in New York those tests are being conducted. Since upstate New York has a lower rate of positive tests than New York City, for example, doing more tests upstate but fewer in New York City could artificially depress the statewide positive test rate. That is not what’s happening here, however. Instead, if we break New York into three parts, we find a decline in the rate of positive tests in each one.</p>
<p>In New York City &#8212; applying a trend line to smooth out slight fluctuations from day to day &#8212; the share of positive tests has declined from a peak of around 57 percent on March 30 to around 42 percent now. In five suburban counties that are part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area">New York City metro area</a> &#8212; Suffolk and Nassau Counties on Long Island, and Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties in the Hudson Valley &#8212; positives have fallen from a peak of around 50 percent on April 1 to 38 percent now. And in the rest of the state &#8212; which I’m referring to as upstate New York, though the definition of “upstate” is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/19/so-what-is-upstate-new-york-exactly/">controversial</a> &#8212; positives peaked at around 22 percent on April 2 and have now fallen to about 17 percent.</p>

<p>These communities haven’t followed exactly the same curves. The suburbs were home to some <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-rochelle-ghost-town-coronavirus-outbreak-national-guard">initial, very bad outbreaks</a>. However, the city then had steeper, sharper growth and a higher but slightly earlier peak than the suburbs.</p>
<p>In upstate New York, the rate of positive tests was never as high as it was in the city or the suburbs, but it also hasn’t declined as much.</p>
<p>The five New York City boroughs have also had different trajectories. Queens had the highest peak, but has since seen the steepest decline. Manhattan had a lower rate of positive tests than the other boroughs, although that could reflect the fact that residents of Manhattan are wealthier and could find ways to get tested even with limited symptoms.</p>
<p>Staten Island has followed a slightly worrying path, with the rate of positive tests having declined somewhat from their peak, but then leveling off rather than continuing to decline as sharply as in the other four boroughs and in the suburbs. Staten Island is home to many essential service workers such as police and firefighters who are <a href="https://www.silive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/2-dozen-staten-island-cops-with-coronavirus-de-blasio-addresses-manpower-concerns.html">testing positive for COVID-19 at high rates</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_270011" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="">
					<img class="size-full wp-image-270011" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-coronyc-0414-3a.png" alt="" width="575" height="489" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-coronyc-0414-3a.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver-coronyc-0414-3a.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure>
		
<p>But overall, the news is positive in New York. It’s also a sign of the importance of social distancing &#8212; which means that the rates of new cases could increase again if measures are relaxed.</p>
<p>If the peak in the rate of positive tests came on or around March 31, it’s likely that the peak in actual <i>infections</i> came sooner than that &#8212; probably two or perhaps even three weeks sooner, given the lag between <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsymptoms.html">when people get infected and when they become symptomatic</a>, and how long it takes for symptomatic people to get tested and for their tests to show up in the data. That would mean it came in mid-March, a time when New York City was &#8212; belatedly, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-response-delays.html">some public health officials</a> &#8212; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-shutdown.html">closing schools, along with bars, restaurants and other businesses</a>.</p>
<p>The governor’s <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-issues-guidance-essential-services-under-new-york-state-pause-executive-order">statewide stay-at-home order</a>, meanwhile, didn’t formally begin until the evening of March 22, which could be reflected in the slightly later peaks outside of New York City.</p>
<p>The decline in the rate of positive tests has not been especially steep, however &#8212; at least not until the past two days, when it was sharper. If taken at face value, it would imply that the <a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/mathematical-models~mathematical-models-models.htm~mathematical-models-2.2.htm">effective reproduction number</a> (sometimes called R), or how many additional infections are produced by each infected person, is below 1, but perhaps only slightly below 1. When that number is above 1, the number of new infections will continue to increase, while if it’s below 1, the number of new infections will decrease. But if the reproduction number is <i>close</i> to 1 &#8212; say, 1.1 or 0.9 &#8212; the increases or decreases will be gradual, with a long, relatively flat plateau rather than a sharp peak.</p>
<p>We don’t know for sure yet whether New York is going to follow that course. In Italy, the decline in the rate of positive tests was <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1249010536106377216?s=20">initially fairly modest</a>, producing a <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/">plateau for a week or two</a>, before later picking up steam.</p>
<p>Warmer weather <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/health-wellness/study-on-new-coronavirus-says-warmer-weather-may-slow-covid-19-spread-and-cooler-weather-may-accelerate-it/707177">could also help</a>, although the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-warm-weather-will-not-slow-covid-19-transmission">evidence for this is mixed</a>. There is also a lot of uncertainty about how many people in New York ultimately have or had the coronavirus. If many people had it &#8212; as implied by the New England Journal of Medicine letter &#8212; then <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/herd-immunity">herd immunity could potentially play <i>some</i> role</a> in lowering <i>R</i>, though likely not enough to reduce it below 1 on its own until a large share of the population has become immune.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps more likely, though, that New York has been beating COVID-19 by a relatively thin margin so far, and therefore it doesn’t have a lot of margin for error. That’s a lot better than the alternative case where the city and state were losing the fight and the number of hospitalized patients continued to rise at their earlier rates. But it also means that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html">city, state and regional leaders will have to be smart about reopening the economy</a> and relaxing social distancing measures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><i>“The [&#8230;] pitch is a mix of idealism and a shouting anger about the system, but at its heart is a hard-nosed math: He’s the only candidate with a sizable chunk of the electorate that won’t waver, no matter what, so a field that keeps growing and splitting support keeps making things easier.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>As I’m sure you’ve probably guessed, this passage seems like it could be about Donald Trump’s campaign for the Republican nomination in 2016<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="7" href="#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe apart from the part about &ldquo;idealism.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-7">7</sup></a> &#8212; but it’s actually about Bernie Sanders’s quest for the Democratic nomination this year. It comes from an April 2019 <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/04/bernie-sanders-thinking-he-will-win-it-all-2020/587326/">feature</a> by the Atlantic’s Edward-Isaac Dovere that I consider to be a lodestar for Sanders’s strategy since it contains a lot of on-the-record reporting from Sanders campaign.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="8" href="#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Without, frankly, a lot of pushback, either from the reporter himself or from rival campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-8">8</sup></a></p>
<p>The article also reveals how the conventional wisdom about how primary campaigns have changed, in light of Trump winning the Republican nomination in 2016 and Sanders’s better-than-expected performance against Hillary Clinton that year. In particular, it reflects several common assumptions in media coverage of the race this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a divided field, the goal is to have the largest, most enthusiastic base.</li>
<li>Reaching out to different factions of your party is not that important &#8212; and may even dilute your differentiation from the other candidates. As long as you’re winning the <i>plurality</i> of votes, you’ll win enough states and the rest of the party will eventually come around.</li>
<li>There is no need to make peace with the party establishment. In our populist era, nominations are won from the grassroots up. Voters don’t care about things like endorsements, and “party elites” are largely feckless.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, if you’d beamed down to Planet Earth from some alien civilization in January 2016 and only seen that year’s primaries, those might be the lessons that you’d take away about how primaries work. They’re a reasonably apt description of the GOP primary, where the Republican establishment <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-party-may-be-failing/">belly flopped in trying to stop Trump</a>. The Democratic primary was a bit more complicated. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/was-the-democratic-primary-a-close-call-or-a-landslide/">Clinton beat Sanders by a rather clear margin</a> in the end.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="9" href="#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Even though Sanders won a number of states in 2016 that didn&rsquo;t translate into an especially close race for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/D&quot;&gt;votes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/&quot;&gt;delegates&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, at least some of Sanders&rsquo;s success &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-was-helped-by-the-neverhillary-vote-what-does-that-mean-for-his-chances-now/&quot;&gt;came from #NeverHillary voters&lt;/a&gt; who weren&rsquo;t necessarily on board with Sanders&rsquo;s platform but were just looking for some alternative to Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-9">9</sup></a> Still, Sanders overperformed expectations by enough as to at least not <i>contradict</i> the notion that 2016 was the new normal.</p>
<p>But focusing on only what happened in the most recent election is a dumb way to do analysis. The media and campaign professionals <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lessons+of+2016+election&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS779US779&amp;oq=lessons+of+2016+election&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33l6.2098j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">spend endless amounts of time trying to draw “lessons” from elections</a> because they are so consequential, but you can’t escape the fact that presidential elections happen only once every four years. No matter how many lessons you might try to draw from any <i>one</i> example, you’re still dealing with a sample size of one.</p>
<p>Rather, the history of the primaries &#8212; both in terms of how the media covers them and how campaigns wage them &#8212; is often one of fighting the last war and <i>overcompensating</i> for perceived mistakes from four years earlier. I’m not claiming to be immune from this either. One of the reasons that I initially <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-i-acted-like-a-pundit-and-screwed-up-on-donald-trump/">bought so heavily into “The Party Decides” hypothesis</a> in 2016 &#8212; which implied that Trump’s lack of support from the Republican party establishment would eventually doom him &#8212; was because of the Republican primary in 2012, when a series of insurgent candidates (Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain, Rick Santorum) briefly <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html">surged in the polls</a> only to eventually lose to the slow-and-steady (and establishment-backed) Mitt Romney.</p>
<p>But Romney’s win in 2012 was in line with the longer history of the primaries, which underscores that building coalitions across the different wings of your party (Romney <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-goes-on-offensive-in-ohio/2012/09/10/9e229690-fb84-11e1-b153-218509a954e1_story.html">tried to unite conservatives and moderates</a>, for instance) is usually a good strategy for winning instead of relying on just one faction. And as you can see in the table below, the establishment usually does win out in the end:</p>

<p>Of course, a result like Romney’s win in 2012 that <i>confirms</i> your theories and priors can create its own issues &#8212; it can make you overconfident. You may mistakenly assume, for instance, that something is true 100 percent of the time when it’s actually only true, say, 80 percent of the time.</p>
<p>But while overconfidence is a serious problem, it’s probably better than assuming that an <i>abnormal</i> result (say, something that is true 20 percent of the time) is the new normal. You can see lots of this upside-down thinking in media coverage of elections since 2016. Because Trump won the general election as a (<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/">modest</a>) underdog in 2016, a lot have inferred that underdogs not only can win, but that they <i>usually</i> win. Before the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2017, for instance, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/will-gillespie-take-virginia-the-panel-debates-1089389635650">a lot of pundits predicted Republican Ed Gillespie would win</a> despite being narrowly <i>behind</i> Democrat Ralph Northam in the polls. Northam won by 9 points instead.</p>
<p>It’s not just the media who makes these mistakes, however. It’s also the campaigns themselves. So while I don’t intend to do a long post-mortem of the Sanders campaign &#8212; instead, see my <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/did-sanders-blow-it-for-the-democratic-left-or-was-the-nomination-always-out-of-reach/">colleague Perry Bacon Jr.’s comprehensive analysis on what went wrong and why</a> &#8212; I do want to take a quick inventory of the ways that the 2020 Democratic primary was different from the Republican primary in 2016.</p>
<p>Most of these problems were fairly predictable and known in advance. To ensure you that I’m not engaging in <i>too</i> much hindsight bias &#8212; because it’s always easier to say what went wrong with campaigns once you know who won and who lost &#8212; I’d point you toward this <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-can-win-but-he-isnt-polling-like-a-favorite/">cautiously pessimistic take on Sanders from April 2019</a> and this <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sanders-might-have-a-ceiling-but-there-are-still-several-ways-he-could-win/">cautiously optimistic one from just after the New Hampshire primary</a>, which reflects how my thinking about the Sanders’s campaign evolved as it was happening in real-time. I started out thinking that Sanders’s factional, us-versus-them, screw-the-establishment strategy was a poor one. But it seemed to be going about as well as it possibly could after New Hampshire with the rest of the field divided.</p>
<p>So here are some potential flaws in Sanders’s strategy &#8212; and reasons why the precedent set by Trump’s win in 2016 might not have applied to his chances this year:</p>
<p><b>First, Democratic primaries and caucuses do not use winner-take-all rules, while many Republican states do.</b> That makes it much harder for someone to be in a commanding position by narrowly winning primaries. Instead, in a multi-candidate race, you have to eventually broaden your coalition to avoid a contested convention.</p>
<p>In consideration of this, some elements of Sanders’s strategy simply never made a lot of sense. Here’s another key passage from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/04/bernie-sanders-thinking-he-will-win-it-all-2020/587326/">that Atlantic article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>He’s counting on winning Iowa and New Hampshire, where he was already surprisingly strong in 2016, and hoping that Cory Booker and Kamala Harris will split the black electorate in South Carolina and give him a path to slip through there, too. And then, Sanders aides believe, he’ll easily win enough delegates to put him into contention at the convention. They say they don’t need him to get more than 30 percent to make that happen.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Sanders’s campaign was right that it could win around 30 percent of the vote with their base and that they could win early states with that amount &#8230; but it never really had a plan for what came after that. Dovere’s article makes it sound as though Sanders was actually counting on a contested convention, an awfully risky approach given that contested conventions are: (i) highly unpredictable and (ii) not likely to be favorable terrain for Sanders, given his lack of support from the establishment and that <a href="https://www.270towin.com/content/superdelegate-rule-changes-for-the-2020-democratic-nomination">superdelegates would be allowed to vote on the second and subsequent ballots</a>.</p>
<p><b>Second, Trump’s ideological ambiguity may have helped him in 2016, while Sanders got stuck in a “lane” this year.</b> Trump may not have done that much <i>traditional</i> outreach to different parts of the GOP, but Republican voters from several wings of the party, perhaps not being quite sure what to make of a candidate like Trump who was reactionary on some issues (say, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-polls-showing-daca-as-popular-even-among-republicans-dont-tell-the-whole-story/">immigration</a>) and quite moderate on others (say, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/us/politics/trump-lgbt-rights.html">gay marriage</a>), were nonetheless Trump-curious. And that range of appeal was reflected in the primary results. In the Michigan Republican primary for instance, Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/primaries/polls/mi/Rep">won the support</a> of 35 percent of “very conservative” voters, 37 percent of “somewhat conservative” voters and 37 percent of moderate voters, according to exit polls.</p>
<p>By contrast Sanders ran <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/sanders-intersectionality-working-class/">further to the left in 2020 than he did in 2016</a>, with a message that shifted from economic populism to a broader and more “intersectional” leftism. This shift was reflected at the ballot box, too. For instance, Sanders <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/michigan/democratic">won just 24 percent of moderates in the Michigan Democratic primary this year</a> (but 63 percent of “very liberal” voters) &#8212; as compared <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/primaries/polls/mi/dem">44 percent of moderates</a> and 59 percent of “very liberal” voters in 2016.</p>
<p><b>Third, the importance that Democratic voters attached to “electability” and to beating Trump may have made them more willing to take cues from the establishment</b>. Electability is a whole subject unto itself that I’m not going to do justice to here. I do think electability may be a <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1246943229121093632?s=20">teensy, tiny bit overrated</a> as a reason for why Sanders lost. While perceptions of electability probably hurt Sanders relative to Joe Biden, it also probably <i>helped</i> him relative to candidates who weren’t white men: <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-people-keep-asking-elizabeth-warren-whether-she-can-win/">most notably, Elizabeth Warren</a>.</p>
<p>Still, electability was important. In that Michigan exit poll, 58 percent of Democratic voters said they preferred a candidate that could beat Trump to someone who agreed with them on the issues &#8212; and 62 percent of the “beat Trump” voters went for Biden.</p>
<p><b>Fourth, Democratic party elites had an opportunity to learn from Republicans in 2016, and this may have made them more aggressive in backing Biden after South Carolina. </b>One reason to be careful of declaring a “new normal” in any trend involving human behavior is that humans have an opportunity to learn from what happened last time and change course. The establishment’s failures in 2016 may have made partly elites reluctant to weigh in early on in the race this time around. But once they perceived Sanders as the true front-runner after Nevada, and Biden began to gain a little bit of momentum as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/south-carolina/">he surged to a lead in South Carolina polls</a>, party elites <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-endorsements/democratic-primary/">got behind Biden at extremely rapid rates</a>. It’s hard to know if this would have played out the same way if there wasn’t 2016 to learn from.</p>
<p><b>Fifth, Trump’s success in 2016 may have reflected an unusually weak field of alternatives rather than a new paradigm. </b>I’m not going to spend much time on this one, because it’s rather subjective. Were Warren, Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, etc. better candidates than Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, etc.? I don’t know. But Democratic voters were certainly <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/284360/democrats-viewed-divided-satisfied-candidates.aspx">much happier with their field of candidates in 2020</a> than Republicans were with theirs in 2016, which is some indication that the field might have been stronger.</p>
<p><b>Sixth, Democrats are a more racially-diverse party, which makes coalition building more essential than it is among Republicans.</b> Sanders didn’t do badly with nonwhite voters &#8212; winning Nevada <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-wins-nevada-putting-him-in-the-drivers-seat-to-win-the-nomination/">largely on the basis of Hispanic support</a> while also winning the support of many younger black voters. That definitely made him a more plausible nominee than Buttigieg, whose support was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/buttigiegs-centrist-pivot-may-be-winning-him-a-new-base/">extremely white</a>, for example. Still, nonwhite support wasn’t a strength for Sanders in a head-to-head race against Biden, who <a href="https://projects.economist.com/democratic-primaries-2020/">generally beat Sanders by wide margins among black voters</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-sanders-may-start-losing-more-latino-voters-to-biden/">held his own among Hispanics</a> in many states. And Sanders’s outreach to African American leaders <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/10/bernie-sanders-black-voters-124773">didn’t always go smoothly</a>, with many members of the Congressional Black Caucus backing Biden instead.</p>
<p><b>Seventh, relying on a fixed base of voters can leave you vulnerable to a turnout surge from other candidates. </b>One rather explicit assumption made by the Sanders campaign was that it could turn out more voters than its opponents. Hence, the campaign believed there was <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1227038583875194880?s=20">not much need to widen their circle to include others</a>. Even their outreach efforts to Sanders-skeptical party leaders focused on trying to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/04/bernie-sanders-thinking-he-will-win-it-all-2020/587326/">browbeat them into explaining why they <i>didn’t</i> support Sanders</a> rather than explaining why they <i>should</i> support him. Again, from that Atlantic article:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That’s the case Sanders and his aides have been making as they’ve undertaken an outreach effort unlike anything from the last campaign, spending hours on phone calls trying to talk political leaders down from being completely opposed to him. They have a basic script: Start out asking where the support for Sanders is among their constituents, then ask why they think those people support him, and then ask the leaders to explain their own skepticism.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>One problem with this attitude is that turnout in an election isn’t fixed &#8212; especially in primaries and caucuses where participation is low. You may turn out a certain number of people, but your base will not be constant as a <i>percentage</i> of the electorate if turnout goes up. In Michigan, for example, Sanders got nearly as many votes in 2020 (576,754) as in 2016 (599,000). But Biden got 838,555 votes in 2020, as compared to just 581,775 for Clinton in 2016 &#8212; part of a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/9/21169367/joe-biden-electability-democratic-primary-bernie-sanders-donald-trump">general pattern where turnout surged more in Biden’s best areas</a>. So Sanders went from narrowly winning Michigan to losing it by 17 percentage points.</p>
<p>Perhaps Sanders was a victim of his own success in 2016. That is, he did such a good job of turning out voters in 2016 that it was hard to <i>improve</i> on his performance in 2020. Still, there was never really any recognition that his base alone might not be enough to win &#8212; and there were never many efforts to expand beyond his base. Indeed, it’s interesting that Sanders <i>doubled down even more</i> on his screw-the-establishment messaging amidst his success in the first three states &#8212; rather than trying to pivot to a more inclusive campaign and unify the party behind him.</p>
<div class="non-jetpack-embed ">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve got news for the Republican establishment. I&#39;ve got news for the Democratic establishment. They can&#39;t stop us.</p>
<p>&mdash; Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1231021453270769664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Maybe, if a few things had gone differently, it would have worked. Sanders did outlast more than two dozen other candidates, after all. Maybe if Michael Bloomberg hadn’t qualified for the Nevada debate and stumbled so badly there, moderate support would have remained divided between Bloomberg and Biden, and Sanders would have had a lot more wins on Super Tuesday. Maybe Sanders’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/bernie-sanders-fidel-castro-florida.html">“60 Minutes” interview hurt him</a>. Maybe he could have gotten Warren to endorse him. Who knows.</p>
<p>But the Sanders campaign was always pursuing a strategy that claimed to defy the odds, that assumed the old rules no longer applied, and that stuck its thumb in the eye of the establishment. It would have been remarkable if it had succeeded. But it’s no surprise that it didn’t.</p>

<p>In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, we dig into some of the challenges that would accompany holding an election amid the coronavirus pandemic. As of the publishing of this podcast, it was unclear whether Wisconsin would be the only state in the country to hold in-person voting in April &#8212; the state is scheduled to go to the polls on Tuesday. The Democratic governor <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wisconsin-governor-suspends-person-voting-tuesdays-election-coronavirus/story?id=70002422">issued an executive order to postpone the election</a> on Monday, but the last-minute move was challenged in court by the Republican-controlled legislature. Late Monday (after we recorded this podcast), the state Supreme Court <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/06/wisconsin-governor-orders-stop-to-in-person-voting-on-eve-of-election-168527">overturned the governor&#8217;s order</a> and it appears the election will happen. The team discusses why the state wasn&#8217;t able to agree on a postponement earlier.</p>
<p>The crew also looked at how different parts of the country have responded to the COVID-19 crisis and whether hot spots, such as New York, are beginning to turn a corner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538">follow me on Twitter</a>, you’ll know I’m constantly going on about how the number of COVID-19 <i>cases</i> is not a very useful indicator of anything &#8212; unless you also know something about how <i>tests</i> are being conducted.</p>
<p>If you’re a regular reader of FiveThirtyEight, you’re probably used to looking at data in sports &#8212; where basically everything that happens on a basketball court or a baseball diamond is recorded &#8212; or in electoral politics, when polls (<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2017/05/15/what-low-response-rates-mean-for-telephone-surveys/">in theory, anyway</a>) survey a random sample of the population. COVID-19 statistics, especially the number of reported cases, are <i>not at all like that</i>. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/">The data, at best, is highly incomplete</a>, and often the tip of the iceberg for much larger problems. And data on tests and the number of reported cases is highly nonrandom. In many parts of the world today, health authorities are still trying to triage the situation with a limited number of tests available. Their goal in testing is often to allocate scarce medical care to the patients who most need it &#8212; rather than to create a comprehensive dataset for epidemiologists and statisticians to study.</p>
<p>But if you’re not accounting for testing patterns, it can throw your conclusions <i>entirely</i> out of whack. You don’t just run the risk of being a little bit wrong: Your analysis could be off by an order of magnitude. Or even worse, you might be led in the opposite direction of what is actually happening. A country where the case count is increasing because it’s doing more testing, for instance, might actually be getting its epidemic under control. Alternatively, in a country where the reported number of new cases is declining, the situation could actually be getting <i>worse</i>, either because its system is too overwhelmed to do adequate testing or because it’s ramping down on testing for PR reasons.</p>
<p>Failure to account for testing strategies can also render comparisons between states and countries meaningless. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1244690011049648134">two recent</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kadhim/status/1244608469635825664">epidemiological studies</a>, which tried to infer the true number of infected people from the reported number of deaths, there is roughly a 20-fold difference in case detection rates between the countries that are doing the best job of it, such as Norway and the worst job, such as the United Kingdom. (The United States is probably somewhere in the middle of the pack by this standard.) That means, for example, that in one country that reports 1,000 COVID-19 cases, there could actually be 5,000 infected people, and in another country that reports 1,000 cases, there might be 100,000!</p>
<p>There is also a lot of uncertainty about the true numbers of infections <i>within</i> a given country. According to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/best-case-and-worst-case-coronavirus-forecasts-are-very-far-apart/">an expert survey published by FiveThirtyEight</a>, the number of detected cases in the United States could underestimate the true number of infected people by anywhere from a multiple of two times to 100 times. The same holds in other countries. A recent <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf">paper published by Imperial College London</a> estimated that the true number of people who had been infected with the coronavirus in the U.K. as of March 30 was somewhere between 800,000 and 3.7 million<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="10" href="#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Based on a U.K. population of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/&quot;&gt;67.8 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-10">10</sup></a> &#8212; as compared to a reported case count through that date of just <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/">22,141</a>.</p>
<p>So in this article, I’m going to work through four examples of how various testing strategies can skew case counts, in the hopes of giving you a more hands-on sense for how the mechanics behind the numbers work. These scenarios are <b>definitely not meant as predictions of what will happen in any given country, state or region</b>. They work with hypothetical data, because we <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/">don’t know all the parameters we’d need</a> to properly estimate a model anyway. The goal is just to illustrate, given relatively simple assumptions, how reported case counts for a disease can differ from the actual number of infections.</p>
<p>At the same time, the parameters in each scenario reflect what I hope are semi-realistic assumptions that at least loosely approximate the coronavirus situation in different groups of countries. Some countries have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html">relatively robust testing</a>. Some started out with strong testing but then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-tests/uk-struggling-with-coronavirus-tests-amid-global-shortage-idUSKBN21C2YT">stalled out</a>. Some were way behind on testing but <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily">soon caught up</a>. Each of these can have different effects on the pattern of reported cases.</p>
<p>You can even download an Excel spreadsheet and input your own assumptions &#8212; though I’m going to wait until the end of the story to give you the link, in the hopes that you’ll continue reading about how this all works before trying to brew up your own scenario.</p>
<h2><b>The not-so-simple math behind coronavirus testing</b></h2>
<p>The core purpose of this exercise is to help you think through how many people might <i>test positive</i> for a disease based on how many people are actually<i> infected</i> with it, given various assumptions about testing. That does require us to make some simple assumptions about the underlying number of infected people in the population. So the scenarios are partly based on what should be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model">fairly simple, standard epidemiological model</a>.</p>
<p>The most important number in any epidemiological model is <i>R</i>, or the reproduction ratio, which is how many people that a person in one generation passes the disease along to in the next generation. For example, if a disease has an <i>R</i> of 3, that means each infected person transmits it to three more people. So one initial case becomes three newly infected people<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="11" href="#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;That is, not counting the originally infected person, so four cases total.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-11">11</sup></a> in the next generation, which becomes nine people, which becomes 27 people, which becomes 81 people, and so forth &#8212; the very nature of exponential growth is that it gets out of hand quickly!</p>
<p><a href="https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/how-scientists-quantify-intensity-of-an-outbreak-like-covid-19">Assumptions about the <i>R</i> of COVID-19 vary</a>, and to some extent that’s inevitable given that there isn’t necessarily one intrinsic number for how the disease spreads from one infected person to the next. In fact, epidemiologists <a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/mathematical-models~mathematical-models-models.htm~mathematical-models-2.2.htm">make a distinction</a> between <i>R</i><i>0</i> (pronounced R-zero or R-naught), which is called the basic reproduction ratio, or how fast the disease spreads in the absence of any interventions or any immunity whatsoever, and the <i>effective</i> reproduction ratio, called R-effective or simply <i>R</i>.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="12" href="#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Although, in practice, epidemiologists we&rsquo;ve spoken with vary in how strict they are about this distinction, and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;0&lt;/i&gt; is sometimes used as a stand-in for &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-12">12</sup></a> R-effective is likely to be much higher on a cruise ship or in a college dormitory than in the middle of a remote town in Alaska where people rarely encounter one another, for example. Moreover, interventions such as social distancing are being undertaken to bring down <i>R</i>, although actions can vary from location to location. The goal, though, is to get <i>R</i> below 1, which means that a disease begins to die out in a population. (It will die out gradually if <i>R</i> is close to 1 and quickly if it’s close to zero, say, 0.2.) Finally, if a disease has spread very widely throughout the population, <i>R</i> may eventually fall because of herd immunity. In other words, enough people are immune to a disease because they’ve already had it, it will not continue to spread as fast.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="13" href="#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you would have given the disease to three people, but two of those people already had the disease and are immune (or were vaccinated) and are immune, then &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; is 1 rather than 3.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-13">13</sup></a></p>
<p>So in these scenarios, I assume that <i>R</i> goes through three different stages that reflect various efforts at containment:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, there’s an <i>uncontrolled stage</i> where the disease is spreading unchecked throughout the population. I assume this stage has an <i>R</i> of 2.6. The WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf">initially estimated <i>R</i> to be between 2.0 and 2.5</a>, but other researchers such as those from Imperial College London have <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-26-COVID19-Report-12.pdf">since revised their numbers upward to around 3.0</a>; thus, 2.6 reflects something of a middle ground.</li>
<li>Next, there’s an <i>intermediate stage</i> where some measures are being undertaken &#8212; businesses are having their employees work from home, large events are cancelled, and people are avoiding some unnecessary contacts and generally being more careful. But, there are no lockdown or quarantine measures in place. I assume that <i>R</i> falls to 1.4 during this stage.</li>
<li>Finally, there’s a <i>lockdown stage</i> where <i>R</i> falls to 0.7 &#8212; or below one, meaning that the disease begins to die out.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.baldingsworld.com/2020/03/29/how-fast-is-corona-spreading-and-how-many-undetected-cases-are-there/">There’s a <i>lot</i> of disagreement</a> about these values &#8212; both how fast COVID-19 was spreading initially and how effective various interventions have been at lowering <i>R</i>. So you are welcome to download the spreadsheet at the end of this article and tweak those assumptions. (Note that the scenarios also account for <i>R</i> gradually reducing over time because of herd immunity, so the actual values of <i>R</i> in the scenarios may be slightly lower than the ones stated above.)</p>
<p>Next: How long does a generation last? By a generation, I don’t mean the Baby Boomers or something like that &#8212; I mean one round of infections. The number that determines the length of a generation is the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/180/9/865/2739204">serial interval</a>, which is how long it takes, on average, for a person to transmit the disease to the people he infects. For COVID-19, estimates of the serial interval hover between <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0357_article">four</a> to <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316">five days</a>. So I assume that a generation lasts five days in the scenarios.</p>
<p>I also assume that the disease has varying levels of severity, and that this affects whether people are tested. In particular, I assume that:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 percent of cases are severe.</li>
<li>60 percent of cases are mild.</li>
<li>And 30 percent of cases are asymptomatic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this seems to match the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/up-to-30-of-coronavirus-cases-asymptomatic/a-52900988">consensus of the medical literature on COVID-19</a> &#8230; but there is a lot of disagreement about these parameters &#8212; and <i>especially</i> on the number of asymptomatic cases. So I’d welcome you to input different values and see how they affect the results.</p>
<p>However, in considering who gets tested, we also need to think about people who have symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 but who <i>don’t </i>actually have the coronavirus. I haven’t seen much research on this question, but thermometer data seems to find that around <a href="https://healthweather.us/?regionId=26065&amp;mode=Atypical">3 percent of the U.S. population typically feels sick at this point in the year</a>. So the scenarios assume that at any given time, 0.1 percent of the population has symptoms that resemble severe COVID-19 symptoms for reasons <i>other </i>than coronavirus (say, a bad flu or bronchitis or pneumonia), and that 2.5 percent have symptoms that resemble <i>mild</i> COVID-19 symptoms for other reasons than coronavirus (say, a mild flu or a bad cold).<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="14" href="#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;We assume these rates are constant throughout the year in the spreadsheet, but you&rsquo;re welcome to tinker with the logic and come up with your own assumptions. If seasonal flu is declining, as it typically does at this point in the year, that could lead to fewer people seeking out COVID-19 tests for non-coronavirus reasons over time. There are other complications, too. Social distancing measures enacted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 also reduce the spread of other contagious diseases, meaning that there are probably fewer people with the flu than usual at this time of year. On the other hand, people with symptoms such as coughs may be seeking tests or medical care because of concerns about COVID-19 when they&rsquo;d otherwise ignore the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-14">14</sup></a> Furthermore, I assume that all people with severe symptoms seek testing (that is, they would get tested if they could), that half of people with mild symptoms do and that 2 percent of asymptomatic people do. All of these assumptions can also be changed in the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! I don’t really consider the scenarios a “model” in the way FiveThirtyEight usually uses that term because we’re not trying to predict anything, we’re just trying to show how different testing strategies can impact the number of reported cases. But, as in the case of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/">real coronavirus models</a>, there are an awful lot of messy, real-world problems we need to consider, too.</p>
<p>One of them is that <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/04/02/i-may-never-find-out-if-i-have-coronavirus">there’s a long lag</a> between when someone is infected, when they develop symptoms, when they get tested and when those test results are reported. In Wuhan, China, the lag between the development of symptoms and test results being reported was <a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca">around 10 to 12 days</a>. And considering it <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html">usually takes at least a few days for symptoms to develop</a>, the lag between <i>infection</i> and a case showing up in the test statistics is going to be longer still. In these scenarios, I therefore assume that there’s a delay of 15 days (or three generations) between infection and the test results showing up in the data &#8212; though if anything I suspect this is too generous, given the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-03-30/its-taking-up-to-eight-days-to-get-coronavirus-tests-results-heres-why">huge testing bottlenecks in places such as California</a>.</p>
<p>Another real-world problem is that the tests aren’t perfect. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/questions-about-accuracy-of-coronavirus-tests-sow-worry-11585836001">reporting</a> by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, around 30 percent of people who actually have COVID-19 test negative for it &#8212; which is what we’d call a false negative. Other <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51491763">estimates of false negatives aren’t quite so high</a>, so I assume a 20 percent false negative rate in the scenarios.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there’s also the question of false positives, i.e., when a test reports that someone has COVID-19 but they actually don’t. This number is harder to pin down, but we can infer that tests rarely produce false positives. Why? In Iceland, where <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/europe/iceland-testing-coronavirus-intl/index.html">large numbers of asymptomatic people are being tested</a>, the overall rate of positive tests among this group is slightly under 1 percent. Given that includes people who probably do have the coronavirus (since asymptomatic cases are fairly common), we can assume the rate of false positives is even lower &#8212; for the purpose of the scenarios, we’ll guess that it’s 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/03/18/the_perils_of_mass_coronavirus_testing_142693.html">there’s a bit of a mathematical twist</a> in calculating false positives. Even if false positives are rare, false positives may swamp true positives if the underlying incidence of a disease is low. Say, for instance, that in the early stages of an outbreak in a town of 100,000 people, 100 people or 0.1 percent of the population actually has the disease. If everyone gets tested, then there will be roughly 200 false positives (0.2 percent of the population) &#8212; larger than the number of people who are actually sick! This is why some of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-tests-who.html">discourse around false positive tests is confusing</a>. It can both be true that the rate of false positives is fairly low <i>and</i> that a high share of positive tests are false. For better or worse, this becomes less of an issue as new infections multiply; there are lots of real positives, so they no longer drown out the false positives.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a further set of assumptions we have to make about how many tests are conducted and who gets tested. But those vary from scenario to scenario. So let’s work through the scenarios now:</p>
<h2><b>Scenario 1: Robust growth in testing</b></h2>
<p>To emphasize that these are hypothetical scenarios and to get you in an appropriately abstract mindset, I’m going to ask you to imagine that these scenarios occur in a country called Covidia, which has 10 million people and where the first infected person entered the country on Jan. 1 (although his case wasn’t detected until later).</p>
<p>In this first scenario, Covidia &#8212; like most real-world countries &#8212; is a little slow to undertake social distancing measures. They take some intermediate steps on March 1, by which time 183,000 people there have already been infected, though far fewer positive tests (just 439!) have been reported. On March 16, with the number of cases still rapidly increasing, Covidia implements a full stay-at-home order (what I’m informally calling a “lockdown”), which reduces <i>R</i> to less than one.</p>
<p>In better news, the testing situation is comparatively good in this version of Covidia. In this scenario, I assume that Covidia starts out with the capacity to do 1,000 tests per generation, and beginning in early February, it improves testing volume by 50 percent per generation until all testing demand is satisfied. I further assume that Covidia rations 75 percent of tests, meaning that tests go to people with severe symptoms before people with mild symptoms, and to people with mild symptoms before people with no symptoms. The remaining 25 percent of tests are available on an on-demand basis.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="15" href="#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;But by April, this is a moot point, since testing capacity has scaled up to the point where basically everyone who wants a test can get one.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-15">15</sup></a></p>
<p>So, what does this look like? Here is how the actual number of <i>infections</i> compares to the number of <i>reported cases</i> in Covidia, first in table form&#8230;</p>

<p class="notes">R is not listed unless there are at least 10 new cases at the start of a generation. Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.</p>

<p><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-1.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-1.png?w=1150 2x" /></p>
<p>There are quite a few things to look at here. <b>The most obvious and probably the most important one is simply that a 15-day delay between when someone gets infected and when their case shows up in the data as a positive test makes a huge difference.</b> Even if everything else was going perfectly &#8212; 100 percent of the population was being tested and the tests are 100 percent accurate &#8212; with an <i>R</i> of 2.6, a 15-day delay would result in there being about 18 times more newly infected people in the population than the number of newly reported positive tests at any given time.</p>
<p>The delay matters less as <i>R</i> declines because if the disease isn’t growing as fast, there aren’t as many new people who get infected in the 15-day period between infection and test results. But it still means we’re always looking two weeks into the past whenever “new” data is reported. And remember, social distancing measures that are effective in flattening the curve may take two or three weeks to show up in the data. This is especially so when the demand for testing is near its peak and there are likely to be longer lags in processing test results.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="16" href="#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;That is to say, our scenarios assume the delay in processing tests is constant over time when in reality it probably isn&rsquo;t, which can create further distortions in the number of reported cases at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-16">16</sup></a></p>
<p><b>Next, even with relatively good testing, you’re still likely to miss many cases. </b>By the end of the scenario on June 29, 1.2 million people have been infected at some point in Covidia, but there are only 186,000 detected cases, for a detection rate of about 16 percent (and some of those are false positives so the actual situation is a bit worse than that). What accounts for the missing cases?</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we assume that many people with mild symptoms or no symptoms do not want to get tested (and nobody forces them to get tested) so they get infected at some point without ever realizing it.</li>
<li>Next, the 20 percent false negative rate means that some cases are missed.</li>
<li>Finally, even where testing ramps up <i>quickly</i>, it may not ramp up quite as fast as the disease itself. The <i>actual</i> peak in new infections in this scenario comes on March 16 &#8212; and at that point, testing is not fully scaled up and a lot of people who would like a test still cannot get one.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>There’s also a third issue: If testing is increasing, the rate of growth of a disease can be overestimated</b>.<b> Alternatively, if testing is stagnant or decreasing, the rate of growth can be underestimated. </b>Note that in Scenario 1, the <i>R</i> you’d infer from the number of reported cases peaks at 3.5, when the actual <i>R</i> based on infections was not quite as high (2.6 before Covidia began implementing social distancing measures).</p>
<p>In other words, the rapid rates of growth in new cases you can see in a country (say, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/germany/">Germany</a>) when it first gets serious about testing are both a function of the number of tests increasing and the number of infections increasing &#8212; and it’s hard to tell what’s what. You can also have problems if there’s a sudden, one-off increase in tests, as we’ll see in the next scenario.</p>
<p>A final issue &#8212; I’m not going to boldface it because it’s less important than the others &#8212; is that in the late stages of the scenario when there is little disease transmission following a prolonged lockdown, many of the newly detected “cases” are false positives. As I mentioned, false positives can be an issue to contend with when the overall incidence of disease in a population is low. They are not the greatest concern in the U.S. or Europe right now, when we’re still in the peak of the pandemic.</p>
<h2><b>Scenario 2: Sudden, one-time increase in testing</b></h2>
<p>What would a more rapid increase in testing look like? In Scenario 2, I’m leaving all the settings from Scenario 1 unchanged &#8212; except for the number of tests. In this new scenario, I assume that Covidia starts out with the capacity to conduct only 100 tests per generation, but then goes on a crash program in February and rapidly increases that number at a rate of 200 percent per generation until it maxes out at 100,000 tests about a month later. This is <a href="https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking/status/1245465267028684802?s=20">similar to the situation in the United States</a>, where testing started out slow, improved rapidly and has now stalled out again.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the distortions between the number of infections and the number of people who test positive are more profound. Even though the actual <i>R</i> is “only” 2.6 in the early stages &#8212; still a very scary, high number by the way &#8212; it will briefly appear to be as high as 7.8 if you’re looking at the number of newly detected cases because test capacity is scaling up so rapidly.</p>

<p class="notes">R is not listed unless there are at least 10 new cases at the start of a generation. Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.</p>

<p>And on a graph, the slope will look extremely steep for a few weeks. You might be tempted to look at a graph like this and say that Covidia is on a much worse trajectory than other countries:</p>
<p><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-2.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-2.png?w=1150 2x" /></p>
<p>But that isn’t getting the story right. What really happened was: Covidia was way behind on testing and it’s playing catch-up, which means that the number of reported cases will increase at very fast rates until it does catch up. But the actual number of infections at any given time is the same as in Scenario 1. That doesn’t mean the news in Scenario 2 is good, exactly. It means Covidia had a very big COVID-19 problem all along that wasn’t being detected until very recently, but it is now finally starting to get its arms around it.</p>
<p>Next, let’s look at the opposite case: Where testing starts out reasonably strong, but doesn’t scale up very much.</p>
<h2><b>Scenario 3: High test floor, low test ceiling</b></h2>
<p>In this scenario, I assume that Covidia starts out with up to 10,000 tests available per generation. However, it scales up tests very slowly (by just 3 percent per generation) before eventually capping out at 20,000 tests per generation. Furthermore, 100 percent of tests are reserved for symptomatic individuals and there are no on-demand tests available. This situation is broadly analogous to some European countries with centralized, socialized health care systems. For instance, the U.K. has tested <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public#number-of-cases">only about 160,000 people total</a> as of Apr. 2, or an average of only about <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1245824771759226884?s=20">7,000 tests per day since March 19</a>.</p>
<p>In this case, the number of cases is substantially underestimated because there aren’t enough tests at the peak of the epidemic. Only about 5 percent of infections are eventually detected.</p>

<p class="notes">R is not listed unless there are at least 10 new cases at the start of a generation. Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.</p>
</footer>
</section>
<p>But not only is the number of cases underestimated &#8212; the rate of increase will also be underestimated. For instance, in this scenario, <i>R</i> appears to peak in the low-to-mid 2’s when it’s actually 2.6. This is because the rate of new cases is increasing faster than the country’s ability to detect them, even if the country rations as many of the tests as it can so it can test the sickest individuals, as we assume that it does. During the peak of the epidemic in Scenario 3, as many as 58 percent of newly reported tests will produce positive results, which resembles the <a href="https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/blob/master/schede-riepilogative/regioni/dpc-covid19-ita-scheda-regioni-20200323.pdf">extremely high rate of reported positives</a> for periods of time in places such as Lombardy, Italy.</p>
<p>So while the slope of reported new cases in Scenario 3 might look more gentle than in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2…</p>
<p><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-3.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-3.png?w=1150 2x" /></p>
<p>&#8230;the country’s situation is actually just as bad. And in some respects it might be worse. Having conducted so few tests, Covidia will miss some extremely ill people in Scenario 3 and they may die as a result of not being able to get medical care soon enough.</p>
<p>That’s not the worst-case scenario, though. Imagine if a country, recognizing that the media tends to fixate on case counts, decides that it can make things look superficially better by decreasing the number of tests that it does.</p>
<h2><b>Scenario 4: A testing decrease</b></h2>
<p>Let’s say that, as in Scenario 3, Covidia starts out with the capacity to conduct 10,000 tests per generation. However, as the case count begins to accelerate, the government panics that the outbreak will make it look bad, so it subtly starts scaling down testing capacity by 20 percent per generation in early March. Meanwhile, being in denial about the scale of the problem, it doesn’t implement a full lockdown until April 10, or more than three weeks later than under the other scenarios.</p>
<p>I should note that this is more of a “thought experiment” than the other three scenarios. Countries from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/china-concealed-extent-of-virus-outbreak-u-s-intelligence-says">China</a> to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-coronavirus-health-russia/sharp-increase-in-moscow-pneumonia-cases-fuels-fears-over-coronavirus-statistics-idUSKBN216305">Russia</a> to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/irans-coronavirus-problem-lot-worse-it-seems/607663/">Iran</a> have been accused of publishing unreliable official statistics &#8212; but I don’t know whether any countries are deliberately limiting testing to keep case counts down.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a situation like this obviously turns out quite badly. Almost 30 percent of the country eventually gets infected:</p>

<p class="notes">R is not listed unless there are at least 10 new cases at the start of a generation. Other assumptions common to all scenarios: Country population is 10 million. People are tested only once. Some people with mild symptoms and most with asymptomatic symptoms do not want to be and are not tested. Tests have a 20 percent false negative rate and a 0.2 percent false positive rate. Test reporting lags infection by 15 days.</p>
</footer>
</section>
<p>Would the country really wait so long to implement a lockdown? Well, if it wasn’t doing enough testing, it might. Because Covidia is reducing the number of tests in this scenario, the number of reported new cases will appear to peak on March 16, even though the actual peak of new infections won’t come until April 5. It will appear that the partial measures it undertook worked, when really they weren’t working well enough:</p>
<p><img src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-4.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/silver.COVID-TESTING.0403-4.png?w=1150 2x" /></p>
<p>In an instance like this, having information on the number of tests would be quite useful, as a high rate of positive tests could be a sign that you’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg. During the peak of the outbreak in April, as many as 64 percent of tests would return positive results in Scenario 4, the number would be as high as 80 percent if not for false negatives.</p>
<div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div>

<p>I already gave away the conclusion at the top of the story, so I’m just going to repeat it once more, hoping that this article has helped to convince you of it: The number of reported COVID-19 <i>cases</i> is not a very useful indicator of anything unless you also know something about how <i>tests</i> are being conducted.</p>
<p>In fact, in some cases, places with lower nominal case counts may actually be worse off. In general, a high number of tests is associated with a more robust medical infrastructure and a more adept government response to the coronavirus. The countries that are doing a lot of testing also tend to have <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">low fatality rates</a> &#8212; not just low <i>case fatality rates</i> (how many people die as a fraction of known cases) but also lower rates of death as a share of the overall population. Germany, for example, which is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6a8d66a4-5862-4937-8d53-b2d10794e795">conducting about 50,000 tests per day</a> &#8212; seven times more than the U.K. &#8212; has more than twice as many reported cases as the U.K., but they’ve also had only about one-third as many deaths.</p>
<p>Put another way: Doing more tests is good, and likely leads to better long-run outcomes, even if it also results in higher case counts that people will freak out about in the short run. I don’t usually like to be so didactic, but I hope you’ll be a more educated consumer of COVID-19 data instead of just looking at case counts ticking upward on cable news screens without context. That context includes not only reporting about the amount of testing, but also indications such as hospital strain, which are more robust since they aren’t subject to as many vagaries about how tests are conducted.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="17" href="#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Although, even in a hospital setting this is something of an issue.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s weekly <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/">politics chat</a>. The transcript below has been lightly edited.</p>
<div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div>

<p><b>sarahf </b>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/sarah-frostenson/">Sarah Frostenson</a>, politics editor): Over the weekend, an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-consolidates-support-trails-badly-enthusiasm-poll/story?id=69812092">ABC/Washington Post poll</a> found that most Democrats now back former Vice President Joe Biden, but enthusiasm for his candidacy was, on the other hand, pretty lackluster.</p>
<p>Just 24 percent of his supporters said they were “very” enthusiastic about supporting him. This marked the lowest level of enthusiasm for a Democratic presidential candidate that ABC/Washington Post has found in the last 20 years. And perhaps even more troubling for Biden was that nearly twice as many of President Trump’s supporters (53 percent) said they were “very” enthusiastic about his candidacy.</p>
<p>This, of course, has sparked comparisons to 2016 when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton found herself in a similar situation &#8212; running neck-and-neck with Trump and with only 32 percent saying they were “very” enthusiastic about supporting her in September 2016. Biden, of course, is already 8 points below that mark now.</p>
<p>So does Biden have an enthusiasm problem? What’s the case for why he might and the case for why we shouldn’t read too much into this now?</p>
<p><b>nrakich</b> (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nathaniel-rakich/">Nathaniel Rakich</a>, elections analyst): I don&#8217;t think this is something Biden should worry about, at least not right now. We&#8217;ve just come off a knock-down, drag-out, 15-month-long primary fight. And some would argue it&#8217;s still going on, with Sen. Bernie Sanders still contesting the nomination!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot to ask for the party to be totally united at this early juncture. I&#8217;d guess that, by September, Biden will have as good or better enthusiasm numbers as Clinton did in September 2016.</p>
<p><b>natesilver </b>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/">Nate Silver</a>, editor in chief): It feels so quaint to be debating a horse-race question in the middle of a pandemic.</p>
<p>But basically: I don&#8217;t think enthusiasm is a terribly meaningful indicator above and beyond what is already reflected in polls.</p>
<p>Sanders&#8217;s voters were more enthusiastic than Biden&#8217;s in the primaries. But he&#8217;s actually tended to underperform his polls. Sometimes higher enthusiasm means you have a narrower base, and the other candidate has more room to turn out undecideds, etc.</p>
<p>An important qualification to all of this is that most of the polls so far are conducted among registered voters when really we want to see likely voter polls, which won&#8217;t really be reliable for another several months.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, Biden leads in most <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/">general election national polls</a> right now, but likely-voter polls tend to be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voter-polls-will-usually-overrate-democrats/">a few points better for Republicans</a> than registered-voter polls, and as Nate says, we don’t have a ton of these polls right now.</p>
<p><b>perry </b>(<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/perry-bacon-jr/">Perry Bacon Jr.</a>, senior writer): It&#8217;s hard to say much about enthusiasm right now since we are still in the midst of the Demcoratic primary ending. For instance, I think enthusiasm around him could still grow, especially after Barack and Michelle Obama have enthusiastically endorsed him, Sanders is behind him, and he has picked a running mate who perhaps excites the party.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>That&#8217;s fair, but how do we reconcile that Trump&#8217;s very enthusiastic support is so much higher than Biden&#8217;s &#8212; 29 points?</p>
<p><b>perry: </b>Trump is the Republican Party’s candidate, and he just <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-wins-enough-delegates-to-become-gops-presumptive-nominee">won his primary with overwhelming support</a>. The party is unified behind him. People have voted for him once. I&#8217;m not surprised his supporters are fairly enthusiastic about him.</p>
<p><a href=""><img alt="FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Why Trump&#039;s Approval Rating Has Increased" class="abc-poster-video" width="640" height="360" src="https://s.abcnews.com/images/fivethirtyeight/200330_Pod_16x9_hpMain_16x9_1600.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>I don&#8217;t care how much higher a quality is that doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>But honestly, I think this discussion is premature in some ways. The general election campaign hasn&#8217;t begun. The primary campaign is in a zombie-like state between being sort of finished and sort of not.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in the midst of a pandemic. And we don&#8217;t have very many likely-voter polls, and to the extent we do, they&#8217;re not liable to be very reliable anyway at this early stage.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Democrats can be very enthusiastic about beating Trump even if they&#8217;re not that enthusiastic about Biden.</p>
<p><b>perry: </b>Right, that&#8217;s the most important thing.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, I find it hard to get worked up by any general-election polling at this point. We&#8217;re still so early in this massive news story that could significantly help or hurt Trump.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>But is it a bad sign for Biden &#8212; and enthusiasm for his campaign &#8212; that 15 percent of Sanders supporters in the ABC poll say they&#8217;ll vote for Trump?</p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>Twelve percent of Sanders primary voters <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-was-helped-by-the-neverhillary-vote-what-does-that-mean-for-his-chances-now/">voted for Trump in 2016</a>, and another 14 percent voted for a third-party candidate or didn&#8217;t vote. So those numbers are in line with four years ago. And there are fewer Sanders voters than there were four years ago, so if anything those numbers are better for Biden than they were for Clinton.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, historically, that would be a totally normal number. In addition to the numbers Nate cites for 2016, another study found that <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/hillygus/files/2014/06/hendersonhillygustompsonPOQ.pdf">25 percent of Clinton voters</a> voted for McCain over Obama in 2008.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not like this is something past presidential candidates haven&#8217;t had to overcome as well. It can make a difference in a close election, but bigger factors (e.g., the national environment, the economy) will probably determine the outcome in the end.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>OK. So what I&#8217;m hearing is that the idea that Biden has a real enthusiasm gap is &#8212; at least at this point &#8212; overrated! But isn&#8217;t it at least somewhat worrisome that there now appears to be an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/politics/andrew-cuomo.html">effort to draft New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for president</a>?</p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>Ohhhhh Sarah, this is such trollbait.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Let&#8217;s be clear — that &#8220;ooh, Andrew Cuomo should run for president!&#8221; talk is utterly nonsensical, non-serious and half-baked.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>It is! I&#8217;m not defending it. But look at what happened when that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/do-you-buy-that-democratic-voters-want-a-new-2020-candidate/">talk took off last fall</a>. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick both entered the race as opposed to throwing their support behind someone else.</p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>People don&#8217;t understand the process. People think you can magically wave a magic wand and that Cuomo becomes the nominee.</p>
<p>Look, if Biden drops out for some reason (health, scandal, etc.), then, obviously, you&#8217;ll need a different nominee.</p>
<p>And I do think Cuomo might be the second-most likely nominee, after Biden.</p>
<p>If you need an emergency replacement nominee because Biden drops out, he&#8217;s fairly compatible with Biden ideologically.</p>
<p>And frankly, the &#8220;emergency replacement&#8221; scenario &#8212; while unlikely &#8212; is still probably more likely than &#8220;Bernie wins all remaining contests by 20 points and wins a pledged-delegate plurality&#8221; scenario.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I do wonder to what extent people <i>actually</i> believe/want Cuomo to be the nominee, and how much is just a fun daydream.</p>
<p><b>perry: </b>I live in Kentucky. People are suddenly talking very positively about our Gov. Andy Beshear, who is a Democrat. This is in part because Trump is doing press conferences in which he ignores the evidence and seems as interested in defending himself as he is in addressing the issues. So Cuomo comes off well in comparison, as do other governors, like Ohio’s Mike DeWine, a Republican.</p>
<p>It also helps that Cuomo is doing a lot of media and lives in the media capital of the United States. Plenty of governors would be getting buzz if they were doing a competent job and were based in NYC, for example, Gavin Newsom (California), Jay Inslee (Washington), Beshear, DeWine.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I think the Cuomo thing — both talk of him becoming the nominee and his role as a leader on the coronavirus in general — has been overinflated by the New York-centric media.</p>
<p><b>perry: </b>Also, Biden has not been super-impressive in his media appearances, so there is that.</p>
<p>Cuomo has been better on that front, as have other governors.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>But Biden has been kind of missing from the coronavirus response, right? Part of that is because, as you all point out, he&#8217;s not a current governor tasked with spearheading preventive measures in his state, but it does seem as if it’s harder for him to have a natural place in the conversation.</p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>I don&#8217;t think anything Biden&#8217;s doing right now matters very much.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also done more than the <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1244703558114717696?s=20">media has generally acknowledged</a>.</p>
<p><b>perry: </b>I think Biden is in the conversation. But his general ideas (Trump should listen to the medical experts, social distancing should continue) are what basically the media, governors, experts, everyone else is saying. Biden is not trying to stand out in that conversation or be interesting, which I think is normatively good. He is not offering weird ideas to stand out.</p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>The narrative is dumb. It&#8217;s always dumb at this stage of the campaign, when the primary winner has in all probability been decided but it&#8217;s not technically over yet. It would be a lot worse if not for coronavirus since the media would have a lot more news cycles to fill with fake drama.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>Yeah, Sarah, Biden hasn&#8217;t been as much of a presence on our TV sets, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s his fault, as Nate pointed out. I think cable news just hasn&#8217;t been giving him a lot of airtime. The other day, major networks decided to air <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/politics/joe-biden-2020-virus.html">Cuomo&#8217;s briefing on the coronavirus</a> instead of Biden&#8217;s speech.</p>
<p>But what Biden has to say on the coronavirus is more relevant to a majority of the country.</p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>It shouldn&#8217;t give him a lot of airtime!</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s not hugely relevant at the moment.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I think they should give him more than Cuomo! Biden might be president at this time next year. Cuomo governs just 6 percent of the country.</p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>Cuomo is dealing with the realities on the ground in a way Biden isn&#8217;t. And New York has a lot more than 6 percent of coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also doing a pretty effective job of communicating about coronavirus data and where the state and the country is in combating the epidemic.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d get as much press coverage if he hadn&#8217;t been doing a good job with the communication side of things. It&#8217;s earned media in the truest sense of the word.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>That’s fair. A lot of what’s happening now is outside of Biden’s control, and obviously, there’s a lot we can’t answer, but Americans still rate Trump really highly on the economy &#8212; 57 percent said they approve of how he’s handling it, which marked a new high for him in that same ABC/WaPo poll. What’s more, Trump led Biden on this metric, 50 to 42 percent. Couldn’t that pose a real problem for Biden moving forward, especially if it’s harder for him to be a part of the conversation now?</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I think this is Exhibit A for it being too early to say anything. It seems like the economy is going to be in <i>real</i> trouble. If <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2020-03-23/fed-official-unemployment-could-hit-30-as-coronavirus-slams-economy">unemployment hits 30 percent</a> or the gross domestic product growth rate <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/03/20/recession-us-gdp-negative-growth-q2-predictions/">is -15 percent</a>, I don&#8217;t think Americans will continue to approve of Trump&#8217;s handling of the economy.</p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>No, I don&#8217;t think anything about the polls right now tells us very much about what the situation is likely to look like in September, or November.</p>
<p>People haven&#8217;t been living with this for very long. A lot of the consequences haven&#8217;t happened yet. And after the consequences, there&#8217;s the opportunity for a rebound, or a second wave.</p>
<p>You just have to be patient. Right now, I spend a lot more time looking at, say, the number of new COVID-19 cases in Italy than at Trump&#8217;s approval rating. I&#8217;d argue that the former tells us more about his reelection odds than the latter, since it tells us something about the extent to which a coronavirus epidemic can slow down post-peak.</p>
<p><b>sarahf: </b>I can&#8217;t help but think that part of the narrative is being set now, though, about Biden having an enthusiasm problem. Of course, it could be that enthusiasm for Biden doesn&#8217;t really matter because enthusiasm to elect anyone but Trump is a bigger motivating factor, but I do wonder how that plays out in the coming months. Even if the enthusiasm gap isn&#8217;t real, could the perception of one still hurt Biden?</p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>Just one troll question after another.</p>
<p><b>sarahf:</b> I know! But I think people are thinking about this &#8212; and even if it’s premature now &#8212; I do wonder how it takes root, even when it shouldn’t.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>That&#8217;s interesting, Sarah. Yeah, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if cable news continually covers Biden with the implication that he is somehow inadequate or not up to the task of beating Trump. I don&#8217;t know if that could become a self-fulfilling prophecy or not.</p>
<p><b>natesilver: </b>I think if anything people tend to overlearn the lessons of the most recent election. A lot of the templates that people applied from the 2016 primaries to the 2020 primaries led to completely wrong predictions, like vastly understating Biden&#8217;s chances.</p>
<p>The fact that Democrats are worried about an enthusiasm gap because of 2016 could easily help Biden because it will scare Democrats into voting.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I certainly agree that people try way too hard to retrofit the lessons of the previous election. To many (especially those with an anti-Sanders agenda), Clinton lost because Sanders voters weren&#8217;t united around her. But can&#8217;t it just be enough that she lost because it was an extremely tight election and that happens sometimes?</p>
<p><b>perry: </b>Biden could very well lose the general election. And he could lose in the same way that Clinton did &#8212; a center-left Democrat wins the primary on the strength of older voters, particularly older black voters, but then loses in the general, with Trump winning in key swing states even as he loses the national popular vote.</p>
<p>But Clinton almost won and Biden very much could win. I don&#8217;t think Biden has an enthusiasm &#8220;problem,&#8221; but having enthusiastic supporters who are donating a lot of money, volunteering and eventually turning out to vote in large numbers always helps. So getting as much of Sanders&#8217;s crowd on board as possible will be useful for Biden.</p>
<p>Do I think it would be better for Biden if polls showed people were excited to vote for him? Yes, because I do think there is the potential that &#8220;people are holding their nose and voting for Biden&#8221; becomes a narrative.</p>
<p><b>nrakich: </b>I also think a lot of the problem is that no one media members or the Twitterati <i>know personally</i> is enthusiastic to vote for Biden. Which of course speaks to the bubbles they live in. But that can have real effects on the narrative, as Perry said.</p>
<p><b>perry: </b>But it&#8217;s hard for me to look at these polls right now and say Biden has an actual enthusiasm problem &#8212; or really many problems at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Washington state was the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/health/washington-state-nursing-facility-coronavirus-family/index.html">initial epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak</a> in the United States. And New York is now the hardest-hit part of the country so far, with hospitalizations increasing at rapid rates — more than <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/state/new-york/">37,000 people had been diagnosed</a> with the coronavirus in New York as of late Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Because COVID-19 hit blue, coastal states first, and because politics is politics, the response to the pandemic <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/27/coronavirus-models-politized-trump/">hasn’t exactly been apolitical</a>.</p>
<p>But blue states are hardly alone in <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1243331459978493953">what is becoming a nationwide epidemic</a>. Jefferson Parish, Louisiana &#8212; which went for Trump by 15 percentage points in 2016 &#8212; has a <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_907e7d92-6fa3-11ea-9fcd-f3c3cf974ef1.html">death rate about equal to that of Manhattan</a>. And as <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/nyc-is-on-the-brink-as-coronavirus-patients-flood-hospitals-already-under-siege?via=twitter_page">terrifying as the hospital situation is in New York City</a>, hospital capacity is also under strain in states such as <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/03/michigan-hospitals-eye-capacity-issues-as-coronavirus-cases-mount.html">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/us/southwest-georgia-icu-units-full/index.html">Georgia</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, although the number of <i>detected </i>cases is higher in blue states, the number is increasing at a more rapid rate in red states.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="18" href="#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Something to keep in mind as we&amp;#8217;re comparing cases across states: We&amp;#8217;re dealing only with &lt;i&gt;detected&lt;/i&gt; cases, and testing regimens &amp;#8212; quantity and criteria &amp;#8212; have varied from state to state. We can&amp;#8217;t say how these numbers are affected by differences in testing rather than the actual infection rate. But this is the data we have. Our hope is that putting states together into big groups of Clinton states and Trump states will mitigate the effects of testing anomalies in any &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; state. &lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-18">18</sup></a> Moreover, blue states have conducted more tests per capita than red states, so &#8212; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/experts-say-the-coronavirus-outlook-has-worsened-but-the-trajectory-is-still-unclear/">given that the large majority of coronavirus cases remain undetected</a> &#8212; the lower rate of cases in red states may partially be an artifact of less testing.</p>
<p>Here is the data as of late Thursday afternoon, with states sorted by the increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases between Monday (March 23) and Thursday (March 26).<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="19" href="#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Picking the right time interval to analyze changes in the number of cases is tricky, as the daily situation can change rapidly, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/health-care/article/21124496/covid19-case-reporting-faces-major-delays&quot;&gt;bottlenecks in reporting results&lt;/a&gt; can sometimes result in irregularities in any one day&rsquo;s numbers. But a three-day timespan has proven to be a reasonably good compromise as I&rsquo;ve looked at the data in different states and countries.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Nine of the 10 states that have seen the most rapid increase in coronavirus from Monday to Thursday are states that voted for Trump in 2016, led by Texas, where the number of reported cases increased by 297 percent.</p>
<p>On average, states that voted for Trump saw a 119 percent increase in cases over this 3-day period, as compared to an 88 percent increase in states that voted for Hillary Clinton (plus the District of Columbia). Weighted by state populations, the difference is slightly larger: 141 percent in states Trump won and 88 percent in states Clinton won.</p>
<p>For now, states Clinton won do have considerably more total reported cases. As of Thursday, Clinton states had 4.29 positive tests per 10,000 people, as compared to 1.13 per 10,000 people in Trump states. A lot of that difference is attributable to New York; without New York, Clinton states have 1.89 cases per 10,000 people.</p>
<p>But the nature of exponential growth is such that these differences could evaporate in a hurry. If reported cases in Trump states continued to increase at 119 percent every three days (about 30 percent per day) while reported cases in Clinton states increased by 88 percent every three days (about 23 percent per day), then the per capita case count in Trump states would surpass that in Clinton states within about 30 days, or by late April.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the rate of increase will slow in both types of states as we begin to see further effects of social distancing measures in the data. However, these measures were <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-state-stay-at-home-orders-d24a664b-c2cb-4f63-9436-729d3f634588.html">generally enacted earlier and have been more forceful in blue states</a>. That means the rate at which new cases are being diagnosed could slow down faster in blue states than in red states, meaning that red states would catch up earlier.</p>
<p>Blue states have also conducted more testing than red states. In states with reliable estimates of the number of positive and negative tests as of Thursday night,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="20" href="#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;That is, excluding states that The Covid Tracking Project says do not report complete negative test results from private labs, and states that had not updated their number of negative tests as of The COVID Tracking Project&rsquo;s Thursday update&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-20">20</sup></a> Clinton states had conducted 21.8 tests per 10,000 people as compared to 12.5 tests per 10,000 people in Trump states.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="21" href="#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Not including results that are reported as &ldquo;pending&rdquo;; only tests that were confirmed to be positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>That means the true gap in the number of cases may not be as large as the roughly fourfold difference in reported cases between blue states and red states right now. States such as Louisiana have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-coronavirus-hotspot-louisiana-races-to-prepare-for-the-worst-11585228563">discovered they have far more cases than they originally realized</a> as they’ve ramped up testing over the past week, and other red states (and blue states) could follow.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has also led to a slightly higher <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/case-fatality-rate">case fatality rate</a> (the number of deaths as a share of the number of known cases) in red states so far. As of Thursday evening, the death rate per case was 1.7 percent in Trump states as compared to 1.3 percent in Clinton states. This could reflect a variety of factors, including potential underreporting of cases in Trump states,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="22" href="#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Since missing more non-severe cases will lead to a higher apparent case fatality rate.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-22">22</sup></a> the age and health of the populations in each set of states, or the efficacy of responses by local health care systems.</p>
<p>However, the higher fatality rate it is a somewhat troubling sign for red states given that many of them are generally at an earlier point in their <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/investigating-outbreaks/epi-curves.html">epidemic curves</a>, meaning that many people who have acquired COVID-19 in those states have done so recently and have not yet developed the most serious symptoms that could lead to long-term hospitalization or death.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Trump’s approval rating has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/">improved slightly</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the short-term gains, reflecting a possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect">rally-around-the-flag effect</a> at the time of national emergency, may not hold. On the contrary, the <a href="https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/4292/Will-there-be-a-recession-in-Trump's-1st-term">strong likelihood</a> of a <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-gdp-drop-record-2q-amid-coronavirus-recession-goldman-sachs-2020-3-1029018308">potentially very deep recession</a> triggered by coronavirus puts Trump’s reelection chances in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Aggressive measures to slow the spread of the disease, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/25/trump-senate-coronavirus-economic-stimulus-2-trillion/">economic stimulus packages</a> that soften the economic blow, could allow the United States to rev back up to speed in the second half of the year and improve Trump’s position. Without that &#8212; even though there isn’t any perfect analogy to coronavirus in recent electoral history &#8212; the bulk of what we do know suggests that he could be in trouble.</p>
<p>We’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-economic-indicators-best-predict-presidential-elections/">written <i>a lot</i></a> about the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-economic-models-really-tell-us-about-elections/">effect of the economy</a> on <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/models-based-on-fundamentals-have-failed-at-predicting-presidential-elections/">presidential elections</a> here at FiveThirtyEight, especially in the run-up to the 2012 general election, when the economic recovery was a major focal point in the contest between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. For that reason, I’m going to compress a very complicated discussion into under 3,000 words here:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I’ll explain my basic view on how to implement an election forecast based on economic conditions.</li>
<li>Next, we’ll see what a series of relatively simple economic models would say about Trump’s potential performance in the fall.</li>
<li>Finally, we’ll run through some possible objections &#8212; do econometric models <i>really</i> apply for a president like Trump in the case of something like coronavirus?</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: This is meant to be an opening bid rather than a comprehensive evaluation of these questions, many of which will be worth exploring at greater length between now and November.</p>
<h2><b>A bad economy makes life harder for the incumbent party. Beyond that, we don’t know much.</b></h2>
<p>I’ve often found myself <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-radical-centrist-view-on-election-forecasting/">trying to carve out a middle ground</a> between people who think that presidential elections are strictly predicted by economic conditions &#8212; and people who think it all boils down to idiosyncratic factors such as candidate charisma and campaign strategy.</p>
<p>It might surprise you to learn that I’m agnostic in this debate, rather than siding with the seemingly more data-driven <a href="https://thebaffler.com/outbursts/the-do-nothing-discipline-hauser">economic “fundamentalist” approach</a>. The problem with the data-driven approach is that … there just isn’t all that much data to work with. There have been only 18 presidential elections since World War II. (Before that U.S. economic data isn’t very robust.) To account for all of the various ways that the economy can impact people’s lives (for example, joblessness, inflation, take-home income, etc.) &#8212; plus all of the other factors that influence elections (such as incumbency, wars, pandemics, scandals, etc.) &#8212; is not easy to do with only 18 data points.</p>
<p>In particular, we don’t have enough data to make <i>overly specifi</i>c claims about the economy. That is, any time you see what you might call a “magic bullet” claim, such as that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/08/abramowitz.pdf">second-quarter GDP is crucial</a> or that <a href="http://douglas-hibbs.com/HibbsArticles/HIBBS_OBAMA-REELECT-31July2012r1.pdf">per-capita disposable income is the key economic variable</a>, you should be wary.</p>
<p>In fact, magic-bullet models such as these don’t perform very well out of sample. That’s because they’re prone to suffer from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/">p-hacking</a> and <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~mababyak/papers/babyakregression.pdf">overfitting</a> because of the small sample size of post-WWII elections and the large number of ways to design a model. In practice, what this means is that people designing these models can twist enough knobs so that they fit the <i>past</i> data well, but they <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/models-based-on-fundamentals-have-failed-at-predicting-presidential-elections/">don’t actually predict future election outcomes effectively</a> when the modelers don’t know the outcome in advance.</p>
<p>At the same time, it’s very likely that there is <i>some</i> type of meaningful correlation between economic performance and the performance of the incumbent party’s presidential candidate. If you look at a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-economic-indicators-best-predict-presidential-elections/">wide range of economic variables</a>, you’ll find that most of the more obvious ones (GDP or employment numbers) indicate that a stronger economy predicts a better performance for the incumbent party.</p>
<p>The best approach in our view &#8212; and the one we’ve used in FiveThirtyEight’s presidential forecasts &#8212; is to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/measuring-the-effect-of-the-economy-on-elections/">combine various major economic variables into an overall index of economic conditions</a>. To avoid overfitting, we choose variables that reflect a cross-section of economic activity rather than picking ones that happen to fit the results from a small number of presidential elections. In addition, FiveThirtyEight’s Economic Index averages how these numbers have changed at various points, instead of focusing on one particular time frame such as the second quarter.</p>
<p>Overall, the data shows a reasonably clear &#8212; although far from perfect &#8212; correlation between the economy and incumbent-party performance. Since 1968, the worst years for economic performance as of Election Day were 1980 and 2008, each of which were associated with steep losses for the incumbent party. The next-worst economic year was 1992, in which incumbent George H.W. Bush lost to Bill Clinton. The best years for the economy, 1984 and 1972, resulted in incumbent-party landslides, although another good year, 1968, produced a narrow loss for the incumbent Democrats.</p>
<h2><b>A recession would probably make Trump an underdog &#8212; although not hopelessly so</b></h2>
<p>OK, let’s plug in some numbers to our Economic Index and see what it says about Trump. The goal here is to predict Trump’s margin of victory &#8212; or defeat &#8212; in the popular vote; the Electoral College is another issue and a potential advantage for Trump; we’ll talk about that more in a moment. I’m going to run four versions of the model:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Model 1</b>: Predict the performance of the incumbent party based on the FiveThirtyEight Economic Index as of Election Day. We’ve calculated the Economic Index back to 1968, so that’s the data we’ll use.</li>
<li><b>Model 2</b>: The same as above, but using the data for <i>incumbents only</i>. That means we’d include 1972 (Richard Nixon), 1980 (Jimmy Carter), 1984 (Ronald Reagan), 1992 (George H.W. Bush), 1996 (Bill Clinton), 2004 (George W. Bush), and 2012 (Barack Obama) but exclude 1968, 1976 (Gerald Ford was an unelected incumbent), 1988, 2000, 2008 and 2016.</li>
<li><strong>Model 3</strong>: Predict the performance of the incumbent party based on the FiveThirtyEight Economic Index as of Election Day <i>and the incumbent president&#8217;s approval rating</i> as of this point in the election year. For Trump’s approval rating, that’d be 45 percent &#8212; which is his approval in polls of likely or registered voters as of March 24 in the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/voters/">FiveThirtyEight presidential approval tracker</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Model 4</strong>: The same as above, but for <i>incumbent presidents only</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for each model, I’ll run through five economic scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the economy looks like 1984, meaning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU-IBF8nwSY">booming growth</a>.</li>
<li>1996, meaning above-average growth.</li>
<li>2012, meaning sluggish but positive growth.</li>
<li>1992, meaning a mild recession, although on the brink of recovery.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="23" href="#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;By November 1992, the economy was technically in recovery, although the recession of 1990-91 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/cycles.html&quot;&gt;had not been declared over yet&lt;/a&gt;. Our Economic Index for that year, which is based on data as reported in real time rather than as &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.ala.org/index.php/dttp/article/view/6383/8404&quot;&gt;subsequently revised&lt;/a&gt;, is consistent with the economy still being in a very mild recession as of Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-23">23</sup></a></li>
<li>Finally, 2008, meaning a severe recession.</li>
</ul>
<p>All right, here’s what each economic scenario looks like under each model:</p>

</section>
<p>Note that the models are reasonably similar to one another. However, there are some differences. Namely, the predictions are more sensitive to economic performance when we use data for elected incumbents only (Models 2 and 4). That means incumbents like Trump get a larger share of credit or blame when they’re managing the economy, rather than when the torch is being passed, such as between Clinton and Al Gore in 2000 or George W. Bush and John McCain in 2008.</p>
<p>The economy also matters a bit <i>less</i> once you account for a president’s approval ratings (Models 3 and 4) since approval ratings gives us some sense for how popular the president actually is in practice, rather than how popular he “should” be based on the economy. In the pre-coronavirus economy, Trump was less popular than you might have expected based on economic conditions. That could limit his upside in the event the economy recovers or somehow manages to avoid recession. At the same time, he’s popular enough &#8212; and partisanship is strong enough &#8212; to potentially limit his downside in the case of a recession.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in the event of a mild recession &#8212; with economic conditions tantamount to 1992 &#8212; all four models predict that Trump would lose the popular vote by a solid amount, by margins ranging from 4.0 percentage points (Model 3) to 5.7 points (Model 2). And in the event of a severe, 2008-style recession, they predict a potential landslide loss, by amounts ranging from 9.1 percentage points (Model 3) to 14.6 points (Model 2). However, Trump has two potential saving graces:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the Electoral College. In 2016, there was roughly a 3-point gap between Trump’s performance in the popular vote, which he lost by 2 percentage points to Hillary Clinton, and in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping-point_state">tipping-point state</a>, Wisconsin, which he won by about 1 point. Losing the popular vote by 4 to 6 points would probably not be enough to save Trump in the Electoral College, but it would at least be an open question.</li>
<li>Second, these models have fairly high margins of error, which ranges between roughly 5 points and 10 points depending on which version you use. Thus, a model showing Trump losing the popular vote by 4 to 6 points wouldn’t have to be that far off for Trump to win the Electoral College (and perhaps even the popular vote) in the event of a mild recession. In the case of a severe recession, a popular vote win would be quite unlikely, but he’d retain some <i>outside</i> chances at drawing an inside straight in the Electoral College.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Will models like these really work in 2020?</b></h2>
<p>Do models built on ordinary business cycle crests and slumps work in the midst of a global pandemic &#8212; something that the U.S. hasn’t experienced in any recent election year?</p>
<p>I’m reserving my right to change my mind on this subject upon deeper philosophical reflection &#8212; but the truth is, we can’t really know for sure. When we release the full-fledged FiveThirtyEight 2020 election model later this year, we may have it use a combination of several different priors, some of which use our Economic Index and some of which do not. All of this is still in the whiteboard stage at the moment.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are some objections that I don’t necessarily find compelling. Each of these could make for its own article, and we may cover some of them at more length later. But let’s run through them quickly in a lighting round:</p>
<p><i>Could voters give Trump a pass because coronavirus is the cause of the recession?</i> Maybe. But even in the case of ordinary economic booms and busts, it’s never entirely clear how much credit or blame the president actually deserves &#8212; and the answer is, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-presidents-economic-decisions-matter-eventually/">probably less than he typically gets from the public</a>.</p>
<p>Does Trump deserve more blame for a coronavirus-triggered recession than Bush did for the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008, or Carter did for the rampant inflation and the oil crisis of 1979 and 1980? Well, the Democrats will say yes &#8212; especially given Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/kushner-trump-coronavirus.html">slow-footed, erratic response on coronavirus</a> &#8212; and the White House will say no. But the more a recession brings hardship to families and communities, the more the Republican side of the argument will be pushing uphill.</p>
<p><i>But what about Trump’s approval rating improving since the coronavirus crisis began?</i> Indeed, Trump’s approval rating has improved in recent days so that it’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/">among the highest ratings of his presidency</a>. As I mentioned, his approval rating among voters is now roughly 45 percent, which is up from 43 or 44 percent since early March, while his disapproval rating has fallen from 52 to 53 percent to 51 percent.</p>
<p>However, compared with typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect">rally-around-the-flag effects</a> that follow national crises, these gains are fairly meager. For instance, Bush’s approval rating <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/">improved from 51 percent to 86 percent</a> following the September 11 attacks, and Carter’s approval rating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/10/archives/survey-finds-carters-popularity-has-risen-sharply-in-iran-crisis.html">nearly doubled in 1979</a> in the immediate wake of the Iran hostage crisis. (Granted, both of their ratings declined sharply from there.) But Trump is also not seeing nearly as much of an approval rating bounce as other leaders in Western countries, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/giodiamanti/status/1240621153808416778?s=20">Italy’s Giuseppe Conte</a>, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200321-france-s-macron-gets-popularity-bump-from-coronavirus-response">France’s Emmanuel Macron</a>, and the <a href="https://www.afr.com/world/europe/brits-back-boris-on-lockdown-even-as-recession-looms-over-europe-20200325-p54dkd">UK’s Boris Johnson</a>. So it’s not clear that a small approval rating gain is a bullish sign for Trump.</p>
<p><i>Do “the fundamentals” even apply anymore? Isn’t everything different in the age of Trump?</i> Sorry, but this is dumb. The 2016 election result &#8212; a narrow popular vote win for the incumbent Democrats given the mediocre economy &#8212; was actually fairly well-predicted by economic models. (These models don’t say anything about the Electoral College.) The 2018 midterms also went pretty much exactly how the fundamentals predicted given Trump’s middling approval rating and the typical midterm backlash against the incumbent party. Heck, even this year’s Democratic primary, in which <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo">Joe Biden is the very likely winner</a>, has been good for the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-party-may-be-failing/">fundamentals-driven “Party Decides” view of the primaries</a> in which the party establishment has a lot of influence.</p>
<p><i>Could partisanship dull the response to a recession? </i>This is a better objection. With more polarization in the electorate and fewer swing voters, it stands to reason that Trump’s approval ratings will be less responsive to different news events than an earlier president’s might have been. And indeed, Trump’s approval ratings have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/">trended within a narrow range</a> so far throughout the course of his presidency, despite tumultuous events such as the Ukraine scandal and the impeachment proceeding against him.</p>
<p>There is an important catch, however. If the range of possible outcomes is narrower for Trump, <i>that also means the margin of error is lower since the outcome is more predictable</i>. Suppose that in less polarized times, a sharp recession would result in Trump being projected to lose by 12 points, plus or minus 10 percentage points. Given polarization, however, he might only be projected to lose by half as much, or 6 points &#8212; but the margin of error would also be half as much, or 5 points.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Trump <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/">currently trails Biden in most general election polls</a> by a wide enough margin that the Electoral College probably wouldn’t save him. So if higher partisanship means the outcome is more “locked in” and less likely to change, that isn’t great news for Trump.</p>
<p><i>Could an economic recovery in the second half of the year help Trump?</i> Yes, it could. If there’s a sharp decline in economic activity over the next few months, and then a steep rebound, I <a href="http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/a-coronavirus-recession-could-doom-trumps-reelection-chances/">wouldn’t want to have a model</a> that only used second-quarter GDP and pretended everything that happened afterward didn’t matter.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is <i>not</i> a lot of certainty in how long the coronavirus crisis will last, nor how long the economic recovery would take. Moreover, a lot of epidemiologists worry about a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-outcomes.html">potential second wave of the coronavirus in the fall</a>, as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/three-waves.htm">occurred in the flu pandemic of 1918</a>.</p>
<p>If I were Trump, I’d want to think six months ahead to the fall. That means I’d want a broad-based stimulus plan that helps ordinary Americans and small businesses to stay afloat during the weeks &#8212; or months-long shutdown. I’d want to stamp out the disease as much as possible &#8212; even if that means social distancing is in effect for a bit longer. And I’d want to have a Manhattan Project on treatments, testing and surveillance so that the coronavirus is more manageable until a vaccine is developed, which is <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/03/23/heres-a-realistic-timeline-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine/">unlikely until well after Election Day</a>.</p>
<p>Frankly, this isn’t that complicated, and Trump’s incentives are well-aligned. The better off America is by November, the more likely he is to be re-elected.</p>
